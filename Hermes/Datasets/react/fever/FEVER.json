Over his four-decade career, Palmer is perhaps best known for the song \"Addicted to Love\" and its accompanying video, which came to \"epitomise the glamour and excesses of the 1980s\".[1]. Having started in the music industry in the 1960s, including a spell with Vinegar Joe, he found success in the 1980s, both in his solo career and with The Power Station, scoring Top 10 hits in the United Kingdom and the United States.[2][3] Three of his hit singles including \"Addicted to Love\", featured music videos directed by British fashion photographer Terence Donovan.[4].

Before World War I, Armenians occupied a somewhat protected, but subordinate, place in Ottoman society. Large-scale massacres of Armenians had occurred in the 1890s and 1909. The Ottoman Empire suffered a series of military defeats and territorial losses\u2014especially during the 1912\u20131913 Balkan Wars\u2014leading to fear among CUP leaders that the Armenians would seek independence.",

It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world, despite its age. Construction began under the Emperor Vespasian (r.\u200969\u201379\u00a0AD) in 72[1] and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir, Titus (r.\u200979\u201381).[2] Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (r.\u200981\u201396).[3] The three emperors who were patrons of the work are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium; Italian: Anfiteatro Flavio [a\u0271fite\u02c8a\u02d0tro \u02c8fla\u02d0vjo]) by later classicists and archaeologists for its association with their family name (Flavius).. The Colosseum is built of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock), and brick-faced concrete. It could hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators at various points in its history,[4][5] having an average audience of some 65,000;[6] it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles including animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, dramas based on Roman mythology, and briefly mock sea battles.",

Prior to the release of the 2001 debut album Tenacious D, the duo had a three-episode TV series released on HBO between 1997-2000. The series came about after they met David Cross on the LA music scene and Black featured in episodes of Mr. Show with Bob and David.[clarification needed] The band befriended the musician Dave Grohl, which began a relationship between Grohl's band Foo Fighters and Tenacious D.[8] Towards the end of the 1990s, the duo supported large rock acts such as Weezer, Pearl Jam, Tool, and Beck.[4] In 2000, they signed with Epic Records and the year after they released Tenacious D, their debut album featuring a full band, including Grohl.",

            "Permafrost (from  perma-\u00a0'permanent', and  frost) is soil or underwater sediment which continuously remains below 0\u00a0\u00b0C (32\u00a0\u00b0F) for two years or more: the oldest permafrost had been continuously frozen for around 700,000 years.[1] Whilst the shallowest permafrost has a vertical extent of below a meter (3\u00a0ft), the deepest is greater than 1,500\u00a0m (4,900\u00a0ft).[2] Similarly, the area of individual permafrost zones may be limited to narrow mountain summits or extend across vast Arctic regions.[3] The ground beneath glaciers and ice sheets is not usually defined as permafrost, so on land, permafrost is generally located beneath a so-called active layer of soil which freezes and thaws depending on the season.[4]. Around 15% of the Northern Hemisphere or 11% of the global surface is underlain by permafrost,[5] covering a total area of around 18\u00a0million\u00a0km2 (6.9\u00a0million\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[6] This includes large areas of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Siberia. It is also located in high mountain regions, with the Tibetan Plateau being a prominent example. Only a minority of permafrost exists in the Southern Hemisphere, where it is consigned to mountain slopes like in the Andes of Patagonia, the Southern Alps of New Zealand, or the highest mountains of Antarctica.[3][1]. Permafrost contains large amounts of dead biomass that have accumulated throughout millennia without having had the chance to fully decompose and release their carbon, making tundra soil a carbon sink.[3] As global warming heats the ecosystem, frozen soil thaws and becomes warm enough for decomposition to start anew, accelerating the permafrost carbon cycle.",

            "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neurone disease (MND) or Lou Gehrig's disease in the United States, is a rare, terminal neurodegenerative disorder that results in the progressive loss of both upper and lower motor neurons that normally control voluntary muscle contraction.[3] ALS is the most common form of the motor neuron diseases.[8] ALS often presents in its early stages with gradual muscle stiffness, twitches, weakness, and wasting.[3] Motor neuron loss typically continues until the abilities to eat, speak, move, and, lastly, breathe are all lost.[3] While only 15% of people with ALS also fully develop frontotemporal dementia, an estimated 50% face at least some minor difficulties with thinking and behavior.[9] Depending on which of the aforementioned symptoms develops first, ALS is classified as limb-onset (begins with weakness in the arms or legs) or bulbar-onset (begins with difficulty in speaking or swallowing).[10]. Most cases of ALS (about 90\u201395%) have no known cause, and are known as sporadic ALS.[3][11] However, both genetic and environmental factors are believed to be involved.[12] The remaining 5\u201310% of cases have a genetic cause, often linked to a history of the disease in the family, and these are known as familial ALS (hereditary).[6][13] About half of these genetic cases are due to disease-causing variants in one of four specific genes.[14] The diagnosis is based on a person's signs and symptoms, with testing conducted to rule out other potential causes.[3]. There is no known cure for ALS.[3] The goal of treatment is to slow the disease progression, and improve symptoms.[9] Treatments that slow ALS include riluzole (extends life by two to three months) and sodium phenylbutyrate/ursodoxicoltaurine (extends life by around seven months).[15][16] Non-invasive ventilation may result in both improved quality, and length of life.[5] Mechanical ventilation can prolong survival but does not stop disease progression.[17] A feeding tube may help maintain weight and nutrition.[18] Death is usually caused by respiratory failure.[19] The disease can affect people of any age, but usually starts around the age of 60.[19] The average survival from onset to death is two to four years, though this can vary, and about 10% of those affected survive longer than ten years.[20]. Descriptions of the disease date back to at least 1824 by Charles Bell.[21] In 1869, the connection between the symptoms and the underlying neurological problems was first described by French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot, who in 1874 began using the term amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.[21]. ALS is a motor neuron disease, which is a group of neurological disorders that selectively affect motor neurons, the cells that control voluntary muscles of the body.[3] Other motor neuron diseases include primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), progressive muscular atrophy (PMA), progressive bulbar palsy, pseudobulbar palsy, and monomelic amyotrophy (MMA).[22].",

            "Trollhunters: Tales of Arcadia (or simply Trollhunters) is an American animated fantasy television series created by Guillermo del Toro and produced by DreamWorks Animation Television and Double Dare You Productions for Netflix, based on the 2015 novel Trollhunters by del Toro and Daniel Kraus.[2] It follows the story of James \"Jim\" Lake Jr., a teenage boy who finds a mysterious amulet and stumbles across a secret realm inhabited by trolls and other magical creatures. Soon afterward, he and his friends are charged with protecting the world from the dangerous monsters that lurk in the shadows of their small suburban town.. The first two episodes of the series premiered on October 8, 2016, at the New York Comic Con.[1][3] The first season was released worldwide on Netflix on December 23, 2016.[4] The second season premiered on December 15, 2017,[5][6] and the third and final season premiered on May 25, 2018.[7][8]. Since its release, Trollhunters has been widely praised as an ambitious and boundary-pushing animated series.[9]  The series was nominated for nine Daytime Emmy Awards in 2017, winning more than any other animated or live-action television program that year.[10] In its first three seasons, it has also received or been nominated for a BAFTA Award, several Annie Awards, Kidscreen Awards, Golden Reel Awards, and a Saturn Award. The show has also spawned several original children's books and has been adapted into a series of graphic novels by Marc Guggenheim and Richard Hamilton, released by Dark Horse Comics.[11].",

Although it was grouped among the comedies,[1] many modern editors have relabelled the play as one of Shakespeare's late romances. Some critics consider it to be one of Shakespeare's \"problem plays\" because the first three acts are filled with intense psychological drama, while the last two acts are comic and supply a happy ending.[2]. The play has been intermittently popular, having been revived in productions and adaptations by some of the leading theatre practitioners in Shakespearean performance history. In the mid-18th century, after a long interval without major performances, David Garrick premiered his adaptation Florizel and Perdita (first performed in 1753 and published in 1756).",

            "Ian Fraser Kilmister (24 December 1945 \u2013 28 December 2015), better known as Lemmy Kilmister or simply Lemmy, was a British musician. He was the founder, lead singer, bassist and primary songwriter of the rock band Mot\u00f6rhead, of which he was the only continuous member, and a member of Hawkwind from 1971 to 1975.. A foundational force in the genre following the advent of the new wave of British heavy metal, Lemmy was known for his appearance, which included his signature friendly mutton chops, his military-influenced fashion sense and his gravelly rasp of a voice. It was once declared \"one of the most recognisable voices in rock\".[1] He was also noted for his unique posture when singing, which was once described as \"looking up towards a towering microphone tilted down into his weather-beaten face\".[2] He was also known for his bass playing style, using his Rickenbacker bass to create an \"overpowered, distorted rhythmic rumble\".[2] A notable aspect of his bass sound was his guitar-like riffing, often playing power chords using heavily overdriven tube stacks by Marshall.. Lemmy was born in Stoke-on-Trent and grew up between there, the nearby towns of Newcastle-under-Lyme and Madeley, and later the Welsh village of Benllech, Anglesey.",

The 2000 census and 2010 American Community Survey inquired about the \"ancestry\" of residents, while the 2020 census allowed people to enter their \"origins\".[5] The Census Bureau also classified respondents as either Hispanic or Latino, identifying as an ethnicity, which comprises the minority group in the nation.[2][3][4].

Players can interact with small and large monsters on the map by tapping on them, triggering combat.[3] Combat with large monsters is limited to 75 seconds (unlike in mainline Monster Hunter games, where fights may last up to 50 minutes), while smaller monsters generally require just several seconds to defeat.[3][4] Resource nodes are also present in the map, allowing players to collect in-game resources to craft armor or weapons. Purchasable items allow player to temporarily increase their interaction range with the virtual environment.[4] The game contains passive features, providing the player with some resources and marked large monsters for later combat when the game is not active.[4].",

Originating in Phoenix, Arizona, in 1964, Alice Cooper was originally a band consisting of Furnier, guitarists Glen Buxton and Michael Bruce, bassist Dennis Dunaway, and drummer Neal Smith. The band released seven albums from 1969 to 1973, and broke up in 1975.

The event partially took place and the film was partially shot in Sugar Land, Texas.[4] Other scenes were filmed in San Antonio, Live Oak, Floresville, Pleasanton, Converse and Del Rio, Texas.[5]. The Sugarland Express marks the first collaboration between Spielberg and composer John Williams, who has scored all but five of Spielberg's films since; although Williams re-recorded the main theme with Toots Thielemans and the Boston Pops Orchestra for 1991's The Spielberg/Williams Collaboration,[6] The film finally received an original soundtrack CD release from La-La Land Records on June 15, 2024, coinciding with the film's 50th anniversary.[7]. The film premiered at the New Directors/New Films Festival on March 29, 1974 and was released theatrically in New York City on March 31, 1974, followed by a year-long worldwide theatrical rollout. It received positive reviews from critics, who praised Hawn's performance, Spielberg's direction and the cinematography.[8].",

The play has been intermittently popular, having been revived in productions and adaptations by some of the leading theatre practitioners in Shakespearean performance history. In the mid-18th century, after a long interval without major performances, David Garrick premiered his adaptation Florizel and Perdita (first performed in 1753 and published in 1756).",

            "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neurone disease (MND) or Lou Gehrig's disease in the United States, is a rare, terminal neurodegenerative disorder that results in the progressive loss of both upper and lower motor neurons that normally control voluntary muscle contraction.[3] ALS is the most common form of the motor neuron diseases.[8] ALS often presents in its early stages with gradual muscle stiffness, twitches, weakness, and wasting.[3] Motor neuron loss typically continues until the abilities to eat, speak, move, and, lastly, breathe are all lost.[3] While only 15% of people with ALS also fully develop frontotemporal dementia, an estimated 50% face at least some minor difficulties with thinking and behavior.[9] Depending on which of the aforementioned symptoms develops first, ALS is classified as limb-onset (begins with weakness in the arms or legs) or bulbar-onset (begins with difficulty in speaking or swallowing).[10]. Most cases of ALS (about 90\u201395%) have no known cause, and are known as sporadic ALS.[3][11] However, both genetic and environmental factors are believed to be involved.[12] The remaining 5\u201310% of cases have a genetic cause, often linked to a history of the disease in the family, and these are known as familial ALS (hereditary).[6][13] About half of these genetic cases are due to disease-causing variants in one of four specific genes.[14] The diagnosis is based on a person's signs and symptoms, with testing conducted to rule out other potential causes.[3]. There is no known cure for ALS.[3] The goal of treatment is to slow the disease progression, and improve symptoms.[9] Treatments that slow ALS include riluzole (extends life by two to three months) and sodium phenylbutyrate/ursodoxicoltaurine (extends life by around seven months).[15][16] Non-invasive ventilation may result in both improved quality, and length of life.[5] Mechanical ventilation can prolong survival but does not stop disease progression.[17] A feeding tube may help maintain weight and nutrition.[18] Death is usually caused by respiratory failure.[19] The disease can affect people of any age, but usually starts around the age of 60.[19] The average survival from onset to death is two to four years, though this can vary, and about 10% of those affected survive longer than ten years.[20]. Descriptions of the disease date back to at least 1824 by Charles Bell.[21] In 1869, the connection between the symptoms and the underlying neurological problems was first described by French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot, who in 1874 began using the term amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.[21]. ALS is a motor neuron disease, which is a group of neurological disorders that selectively affect motor neurons, the cells that control voluntary muscles of the body.[3] Other motor neuron diseases include primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), progressive muscular atrophy (PMA), progressive bulbar palsy, pseudobulbar palsy, and monomelic amyotrophy (MMA).[22].",
