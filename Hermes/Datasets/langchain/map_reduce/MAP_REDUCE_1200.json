These results, combined with recent progresses in type and spatial control in the formation of defects~\\cite{Robertson_2012,Yoon_2016,Laser_writing_2017} as well as chirality control~\\cite{tunable_QD_defects}, hold a high potential for applications in the design of SWNT based quantum devices.

In this context, the observation of quantum confinement effects in the emitted light of cut, sub-10 nm, semiconducting SWNTs~\\cite{Dai_2008} shall be seen as an additional motivation for investigating the optical properties of our \"QD with leads\" building-blocks.

Higher states m2 and m3 show more symmetry in terms of position of the maxima relative to the center of the QD. In QD II, m1 is shifted to the right side of the QD. We attribute the observed lowest energy states asymmetry (for electrons as well as for holes) in part to their strong sensitivity to weak potential modulations within the QD structure (as we will show in section \\ref{1D}). For QD I, this assertion is supported by the observation of a 0.25 nm high Au(111) terrace edge located around the center of the QD, leading to a supported-suspended interface (see white dashed lines in Fig.~\\ref{exp_data_1}(b) and more topographic details in Fig.~S2(a)-(d) in supplementary information). Such configurations have been reported to induce a rigid shift in the SWNT bands~\\cite{Clair_2011}, for instance here a down-shift in the right side of QD I corresponding to the \"suspended\" portion between two terraces. In QD II, we attribute the spatial shift of m1 to a potential modulation induced by a layer of disordered impurities, most probably residua from the 1,2-dichloroethane suspension, lying between the gold substrate and the SWNT (see Fig.~\\ref{exp_data_1}(d) and Fig.~S2(e)-(h) in supplementary information). \n\\\\",

Without loss of generality, we have simulated short unit cell semiconducting zigzag SWNTs with different combinations of the most probable defect structures. Results for vacancy defects likely being induced by 200 eV Ar$^{+}$ ions, separated by about 11 nm in a $(16,0)$ SWNT are shown in Fig.~\\ref{num_data}(a)-(c) with DV-DV, DV-SV and SV-SV pairs, respectively. The LDOS displays midgap states at the defect positions as expected as well as defect states in the valence band~\\cite{Buchs_Ar}. Most importantly, clear quantized states with a number of maxima increasing with energy are observed between the defects in the conduction band, emphasizing the ability of SVs and DVs to confine carriers. For the asymmetric configuration DV-SV, one can distinguish faint curved stripe patterns oriented from top left to bottom right, indicating a larger scattering strength for DVs compared to SVs. This is consistent with observations in transport experiments~\\cite{Gomez05nm}. On the other hand, the patterns in the valence band strongly depend on the defect types. Discrete states can be distinguished for the DV-DV case, with m-2 being mixed with defect states. For the DV-SV case, clear curved stripe patterns oriented from bottom left to top right indicate again a stronger scattering strength for DV.

Enlarged plots of these boxed regions are displayed in Fig.~\\ref{exp_data_Ar}(a)-(b) and Fig.~\\ref{exp_data_N}(a) for SWNTs I and II, respectively.

The number of maxima increases for increasing $\\left|V_\\mathrm{bias}\\right|$ and the measured level spacings between consecutive discrete states is of the order of 100 meV and larger for both cases. This indicates that defect sites $d3'-d4$ and $d6'-d7$, respectively separated by 12.1 nm and 11.2 nm, act as strong scattering centers able to confine carriers in semiconducting SWNTs~\\cite{Buchs_PRL,Bercioux_prb_2011}. Such intrananotube QD structures will be referred as QD I (in SWNT I) and QD II (in SWNT II) in the following. We estimated the level spacings in the conduction band of QD I to 98 meV (m1-m2) and 116 meV (m2-m3). For QD II, we measured 122 meV (m1-m2), 185 meV (m2-m3) and 210 meV (m3-m4).\n\\\\",
                "\\indent Once chiralities together with potential step heights and positions are optimized, one can fit the height and width of the rectangular tunneling barriers in order to reproduce the experimental level spacings and general LDOS patterns. On a qualitative ground, a symmetric double barrier system results in the formation of spatially symmetric discrete bound states. Increasing both barrier heights simultaneously shifts the bound state energy levels and level spacings up. This leads to sharper bound states as the confinement in the QD is made stronger thus increasing the lifetime of the confined electrons. Increasing the barrier thickness with constant inner edge separation does not affect much the level spacings but further sharpens the bound states. Any asymmetry introduced by a change in the width or height of one single barrier leads to broader bound states. The presence of a potential step modifies the LDOS in lifting the levels of the bound states, with a more pronounced effect on the lower states. In QD I and II, the center of each barrier is aligned with the center of the gap states ($d3'$-$d4$ for QD I and $d6'$-$d7$ in QD II) and the width ratio is kept proportional to the ratio of the spatial extent of the gap states. Thus, by increasing the width of the barriers, we decrease the length of the QD leading to higher level spacings, and vice versa. The experimental level spacings can then be approximated by tuning both barrier widths in the same ratio and the heights individually, knowing that the scattering strength of $d3'$ ($d7$) is larger than $d4$ ($d6'$) according to the observed asymmetry in the LDOS described above \\footnote{The transmission probability through a rectangular tunneling barrier is given by $T=\\left( 1+\\frac{V^{2}\\sinh^{2}\\left( a \\cdot \\sqrt{2m^{*}(V-E)}/\\hbar \\right)}{4E(V-E)} \\right)^{-1}$, where $V$ and $a$ are respectively the barrier height and width.

                "\\indent For QD II, we observed that the measured energy levels are overestimated by a factor $\\alpha\\sim1.29$, presumably due to a voltage division effect induced by the impurity layer mentioned above (see details in supplementary information). We find a good agreement with the experimental LDOS with the parameters: $V_{d3'}=V_{d4}\\simeq$ 0.47 eV, $a_\\mathrm{d6'}=1.5$ nm, $a_\\mathrm{d7}=2.6$ nm and $U_\\mathrm{C}=V_\\mathrm{L}-V_\\mathrm{R}\\simeq 47$ meV. Note that in Fig.~\\ref{exp_data_N}(b) the barrier and potential heights are multiplied by $\\alpha$ to allow a direct comparison with the experimental LDOS. The simulated LDOS shows a pattern with curved stripes oriented from bottom left to top right, as observed experimentally, due to a right barrier exhibiting a larger scattering strength. Also, the spatial profile of the obtained bound states (see lower subpanels in Fig.~\\ref{exp_data_N}(a) and (b)) reproduces the experimental features quite well. Note also that one can distinguish an isolated state in the experimental LDOS at an energy level between m1 and m2, about in the middle of the QD. This state that prevented an accurate fit of the state m2 in the right QD part is attributed to a spatial feature visible in the STM topography image in Fig.~\\ref{exp_data_Ar}(d) (see also supplementary information, Fig.S2(f)), probably a physisorbed impurity which does not affect the LDOS significantly.\n\\\\\n\\subsection{Ab-initio calculations}\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\includegraphics[width=16cm]{Figure_4.pdf}",

Increasing barrier heights shifts energy levels and spacings up, creating sharper bound states due to stronger confinement. Increasing barrier thickness sharpens bound states without affecting level spacings. Asymmetry in barrier width or height broadens bound states. Potential steps modify LDOS by lifting bound state levels, more so for lower states. In QDs I and II, barrier centers align with gap states, and width ratios match spatial extents.

These defects confine carriers within the nanotubes, leading to quantized energy states.\n\n2. **Energy-Dependent Scattering**: The study examines the wavevector \\( k_\\mathrm{n}(E_\\mathrm{n}) \\) for resonant states in both conduction and valence bands. Results show excellent agreement between third-nearest neighbor tight-binding (TB) and ab-initio calculations for pristine nanotubes. The effective lengths of QDs are influenced by the type of defect, with divacancies exhibiting the shortest L_eff due to broader scattering potentials.\n\n3. **Conduction vs. Valence Bands**: In the conduction band, \\( k_\\mathrm{n}(E_\\mathrm{n}) \\) is less than the limiting \\( k_\\mathrm{n,\\infty} \\), indicating larger L_eff due to evanescent modes. In the valence band, \\( k_\\mathrm{n}(E_\\mathrm{n}) \\) exceeds \\( k_\\mathrm{n,\\infty} \\), with L_eff values between these limits.\n\n4. **Nitrogen Ad-Atoms**: N ad-atoms create QD states when paired with different defects, significantly modulating conductance (30-40%) compared to pristine CNTs. Double vacancies exhibit the strongest scattering effect.\n\n5. **Chirality and Stability**: The choice of zigzag SWNT chiralities is influenced by effective masses, enabling the design of QDs with varied level spacings. Divacancies show superior stability at room temperature due to high migration barriers.\n\n6. **Experimental Considerations**: Substrate effects lead to carrier decay and state broadening, which can be mitigated by reducing nanotube-substrate interactions. This could improve the contrast of quantized states and provide deeper insights into QD electronic structure.\n\n7. **Potential Applications**: The creation of QDs with energy level spacings above thermal broadening at room temperature makes them promising for quantum device applications, such as room-temperature single-photon emitters.\n\n8. **Funding and Acknowledgments**: The study acknowledges funding from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) and the BMBF-project WireControl, among others.\n\nOverall, the research highlights the potential of defect-engineered SWNTs for quantum dot applications, with a focus on understanding and optimizing their electronic and scattering properties."

Also called TAVI (Transcatheter aortic valve implantation).\nTetralogy of Fallot \u2013 A rare condition caused by a combination of four heart defects that are present at birth, affecting the structure of the heart and causing oxygen-poor blood to flow out of the heart and into the rest of the body. Infants and children with Tetralogy of Fallot usually have blue-tinged skin because their blood doesn\u2019t carry enough oxygen. Often diagnosed in infancy, but sometimes not until later in life depending on severity.\nTg \u2013 Triglycerides: The most common fatty substance found in the blood; normally stored as an energy source in fat tissue. High triglyceride levels may thicken the blood and make a person more susceptible to clot formation. High triglyceride levels tend to accompany high cholesterol levels and other risk factors for heart disease, such as obesity.\nTIA \u2013 Transient Ischemic Attack: A stroke-like event that lasts only for a short time and is caused by a temporarily blocked blood vessel.\nTEE \u2013 Transesophageal echocardiogram: This test involves an ultrasound transducer inserted down the throat into the esophagus in order to take clear images of the heart structures without the interference of the lungs and chest.\nTreadmill Stress Test \u2013 See Exercise Stress Test.\ntroponin \u2013 a type of cardiac enzyme found in heart muscle, and released into the blood when there is damage to the heart (for example, during a heart attack). A positive blood test that shows elevated troponin is the preferred test for a suspected heart attack because it is more specific for heart injury than other blood tests, especially the newer high sensitivity troponin tests (hs-cTnT).",
                "Please can someone explain something for me. I am a 53 yr old woman and generally fit and healthy. Had 2 ECG\u2019s due to a one off dizzy spell during a stressful time dealing with my fathers terminal diagnosis. The 2nd ECG request did give me concern as i did not know why i had to have one. On 24/01/19 at my doctors appointment she explained that on 3 the leads it showed inverted T waves. And she explained that it may suggest angina. I was so shocked. Wasn\u2019t expecting that. She gave me a GNT (nitroglycerin) spray in case I do get pain and take 75Mg of aspirin. I\u2019m now waiting for a Cardiology referral.\nI am so stressed and consumed by what might be wrong. My maternal grandmother had angina and valve issues. Her 3 brothers all had double bypasses. Could I have inherited this? I am not overweight at 63kg and 5.ft 9. I walk 20-25 miles a week at work and general walking here and there. I started HRT (patches evorol 25 -50) in July as menopause pain was making me feel like I was 90 and was getting me down.\nI am worried so much now and analysing every ache/ twinge I get. I feel like a hypochondriac at the moment. I\u2019m worried what will happen at the cardiologist and what the test will entail and tell me. I am waiting on cholesterol test which I had on 25/01/19. Can I have inverted T waves and be fine. Please help I am so scared and crying far too much.\nHello Colleen \u2013 the first thing is: please take a big deep breath before you read another word here! I\u2019m not a physician so of course cannot comment on your specific case, but I can tell you generally that the definition of \u201cangina\u201d (as this glossary lists above) is \u201cdistressing symptoms\u201d, typically chest pain that gets worse with exertion, and goes away with rest. That\u2019s classic stable angina\u2026 typically caused by something that\u2019s reducing blood flow to the heart muscle (causing the chest pain of angina).",

When fibrillation occurs, the ventricles cannot pump blood throughout the body. Most sudden cardiac deaths are caused by VF or ventricular tachycardia (VT).\nVLDL \u2013 Very Low Density Lipoprotein: Molecules made up of mostly triglycerides, cholesterol and proteins. VLDL, also known as the \u201cvery bad\u201d cholesterol, carries cholesterol from the liver to organs and tissues in the body. It may lead to low density lipoproteins (LDL), associated with higher heart disease risks. VLDL levels are tricky to measure routinely, and are usually estimated as a percentage of your triglyceride levels. By reducing triglycerides, you are usually also reducing your VLDL levels.\nWarfarin \u2013 A drug taken to prevent the blood from clotting and to treat blood clots. Warfarin is believed to reduce the risk of blood clots causing strokes or heart attacks. Also known as Coumadin.\nWidowmaker heart attack \u2013 The type of heart attack I survived, since you asked. A nickname doctors use to describe a severely blocked left main coronary artery or proximal left anterior descending coronary artery of the heart. This term is used because if the artery gets abruptly and completely blocked, it can cause a massive heart attack that will likely lead to sudden cardiac death. Please note the gender imbalance here: despite the number of women like me who do experience this type of cardiac event, doctors are not calling this the widowermaker, after all.\nWPW \u2013 Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome: A condition in which an extra electrical pathway connects the atria (two upper chambers) and the ventricles (two lower chambers). It may cause a rapid heartbeat.\nNOTE FROM CAROLYN: I was very happy when we were able to include this entire glossary in my book, \u201cA Woman\u2019s Guide to Living with Heart Disease\u201c (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2017).\nAre we missing any important heart acronyms/terms from this list?

Also known as Angina Pectoris. Unstable angina (UA) occurs when fatty deposits (plaques) in a blood vessel rupture or a blood clot forms, blocking or reducing flow through a narrowed artery, suddenly and severely decreasing blood flow to the heart muscle. Unstable angina is not relieved by rest; it\u2019s dangerous and requires emergency medical attention.\nAntiplatelet drugs \u2013 Medications that block the formation of blood clots by preventing the clumping of platelets (examples: Plavix, Effient, Brillinta, Ticlid, etc). Heart patients, especially those with implanted stents after PCI, are often prescribed dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) which includes one of these prescribed meds along with daily low-dose aspirin.",

The test is used to evaluate your heart and valve function if you are unable to exercise. It is also used to determine how well your heart tolerates activity, and your likelihood of having coronary artery disease (blocked arteries), and it can evaluate the effectiveness of your cardiac treatment plan. See also TTE and Stress Echocardiogram.\nDressler\u2019s syndrome \u2013 Happens to a small number of people three to four weeks after a heart attack.

                "Three days later, I flew to his place about 400 miles away to take a look at his project. At this point I should probably mention that I consider myself to be fairly knowledgeable about airplane construction, although the vast majority of my experience is with tube and fabric. The rest of this article deals with what I looked for and more importantly what I missed and have had to repair in the last year since I purchased the project.\nWhen we went to the seller's house, I found that the left wing was built using the Dan Diehl wing skins and the right wing skins were leaning against the wall inside the house. Also the canopy was in the house with the canopy covered with paper and tape. I wanted to inspect the fuselage first, so off we went to the shop.\nThere I found a fuselage sitting on it's gear painted in primer gray. The first step was to inspect the quality of workmanship of what could be seen as it sat. The interior of the fuselage looked as if it had been built with a great deal of care. The fit and finish of all of the interior wood was very nice. Even the gussets looked like they had been painstakingly perfectly fitted. The glass work on the turtle back also looked very precise and clean. It was evenly faired into the vertical and horizontal stabs. The tail also appeared to be well built with the exception of a depression directly over the front and rear spars in the horizontal stabs. He explained that when he moved recently, that he had shot the plane with gray primer to protect it from the weather since he wouldn't have ready access to a shop to put it in right away. It ended up sitting out in the hot south Texas summer sun for a few weeks before he got a shop rented to work in. That caused the glass (or possibly the foam inside the horizontal stab) to swell, except that it held onto the spar, so it was slightly ballooned in front of and behind the spars. His recommendation was to fill it back smooth with micro.",
                "At this point the turtledeck looked great and only weighed about 5lbs. but I noticed you could deform the skin by pushing hard on the outside. So I flipped the turtledeck over and from 1/4 inch last-a-foam, I cut two inch wide strips that would run the entire length, forward and aft inside the turtledeck. In effect these would act as composite stringers, I made enough of these two inch wide strips to make up three stringers. One down the center (sort of a backbone) and one on each side of the \"backbone\" half the distance to the edge of the turtledeck. I sanded the edge of the foam so that when covered with a layer of bid @ 45degrees there would be a nice transition from the turtledeck skin up onto the foam and then back onto the turtledeck I scuff sanded and glued the foam stringers in with micro. I covered the foam stringers with one layer of 8oz bid @ 45degrees.",
                "I chose to sand the load of micro off the left wing to see what it was covering. When I got down to the glass, I found that there was no glass for the aft inch and a half of the underside of the wing in front of the aileron hinge. With the Diehl wing skins, you build the wings, then cut the ailerons out of trailing edge of the wing. He had mismeasured and cut too much material off the bottom side of the trailing edge in front of the aileron. It was filled by floxing a piece of spruce into the gap to fill the space between the back edge of the fiberglass and the aileron mount. I chose to wrap the trailing edge of that wing, and the other wing to match with a couple of lay-ups of glass.\nWhen I sanded the primer off the aforementioned damaged trim tab, I found that the hinge was floxed to the leading edge of the foam insides of the tab, but not the glass. I also chose to wrap the front of the trim tab with a lay-up of glass.\nI decided to pull the paper off the canopy and take a look at it before I'm ready to bolt it on and fly. The original builder had blown his own canopy and after some of the previous problems, I was beginning to have some concerns about not having looked it over closely enough. The canopy turned out to have been blow a little too large. It ended up with a little larger bubble for headroom, which I didn't object to. However, it had more headroom on the right side than the left. Yes, it was just a little bit lopsided. The main problem was that the canopy is stretched thin enough that it can be easily pushed in with one hand when the weather is warm.. My fear was that this is just thin enough that it may decide to lay on my head or in my lap when flying on a warm day. It will have to be replaced.",
                "Over the past twenty years I've owned a number of planes, but still always wanted to build my own. I needed one that would fit me, my budget requirements, and have the speed and performance that I wanted. When \"KITPLANES\" published the article featuring Roy Marsh's new KR-2S, it was the first I had heard of any major modifications or improvements to the same old KR design. I believe that article and Roy Marsh's workmanship have probably been the greatest boon to Rand Robinson (RR) in the last twenty years. It certainly caught my eye! Here was the same design I had decided I wanted to build twenty years ago, with all of the improvements I wanted. It was sitting on fixed gear with some reasonable ground clearance. It had the capability to be built large enough to accommodate me. It has enough prefab parts available that it didn't have to be 100% scratch built if I decided to hurry the project along. And it had the speed I wanted. I knew that Roy's published speeds were probably not realistic expectations for the average KR, but after knocking around for the last three years in my Champ, anything over 90 mph seems pretty fast to me.\nAfter purchasing the info kit and the sales video from Rand Robinson, the next step after deciding for sure to build this plane was to order the KR-2 plans and the KR-2S addendum. I finally got my plans and was putting together my first order to start the plane, when my partner in the Champ pointed out that there was a partially completed KR-2S for sale in Trade-a-plane. My initial answer was \"No, I don't even want to look at it. I want to build my own from scratch.\" My partner insisted that for the advertised price and the fact that it wasn't too far away, I ought to at least give the guy a call and investigate it. \"No, I don't think I want to buy someone else's problems,\" I persisted. That night I went home and crunched up some numbers on the calculator and finally came to the conclusion that for the sake of my budget for the next several years, I really should give this guy a call.",
                "At this point it was starting to get late and my ride down needed to get airborne for the flight home. I needed to make a decision about whether I wanted this project or not, but I hadn't inspected the wings and canopy yet. I took a cursory look at the left wing and saw lots on micro built up on it and some bubbles in the leading edge, but nothing that looked seriously wrong to my amateur eye. The right wing was only a set of spars in the shop and the Diehl wing skins in the house, so there wasn't much to look at there. The canopy was wrapped in paper and tape, so there wasn't much to look at there either. I decided that even if there were serious problems in the wing that was built, I would be money ahead to go ahead and buy the project. For the advertised price, I could build a new set of wings and still be way ahead financially. We negotiated a final price, shook hands, took my ride to the airport, and started off in search of a U-haul to haul the project home.\nNow, at this point, some of you are thinking about what I surely must have forgotten to inspect and why didn't I take a local A & P or EAA member along for the ride. First of all, I don't know any mechanics locally that have any experience with glass and our EAA chapter of which I am VP is woefully lacking in fiberglass knowledge. Secondly, as you will see, I missed plenty. Some by ignorance, some by just not looking close enough.\nNow for a list of the problems that I found over the last year and a few of the fixes that I came up with.",
                "I found that the lower set of rear spar attach fittings on the left rear spar were installed backwards with the longer spaced hole towards the fuselage. Since this is the same place that also had the cracked spar cap, it required a major change. Also in the same area he had drilled through the rear spar with a hole saw to create a place for the aileron cable to pass through and managed to cut out the second from the outside vertical brace in the spar. Then he chose to install the aileron bellcranks in front of the rear spar, and cut another hole through the rear spar for the aileron push rod. He also managed to cut out the outside vertical brace in the spar. Since the holes were already drilled through the spar, the choices were to either cut out that section of spar cap and scarf a new piece in, cut the whole rear spar carrythrough out of the fuselage including ruining the left lower wing skin, or do something else creative to reinforce the spar cap and install a custom built set of attach fittings.\nI also found that after I built and installed the right side wing stub ribs and skin that the aileron bellcrank setup would not work as installed. The cable that crosses between the two bellcranks had a sharp uphill from the sheeve to the bellcrank in the last 12 inches on either side. This combined with the radius that the bellcranks turn caused the cross cable to pull up tight when the ailerons were pushed to either end of their travel, but allowed the cables to go very slack when the ailerons were centered. Also the Aileron pushrods needed to pass directly through the lower set of rear wing attach fittings to attach to the aileron. This whole rear spar and aileron bellcrank setup was going to either have to be redesigned or cut out and built to plans. The bottom line is that the problems I observed when I inspected this part were much more serious than expected when I had to fix it.",
                "I decided that I had to remove the rear fittings from the left wing to be replaced with the new set that my neighborhood machinist was cutting out for me. When I put the wing on the work bench to start removing the rear fittings, I thought I had better take a closer look at the bubbles in the leading edge. I found that as I pushed on the leading edge, it delaminated between the glass lay-up on top and the upper and lower wing skin edges that were floxed together underneath. I concluded that that area had to come apart and took a belt sander to the leading edge. What I found was that the leading edge had been floxed together and glassed over, but the mold release had never been scrubbed off the leading edge of the wing. It peeled apart for rebuild quite easily.\nWhen I got back to removing the rear spar attach fittings, I noticed that the woodwork inside the wing looked awfully dull. The reason was that the wing had been closed up without varnishing any of the woodwork. This was rectified with a small hole saw, a number of extensions and a modified undercoating sprayer.\nI also found that the aluminum drain fitting in the bottom of the left wing tank had been glassed into place upside down. The tapered pipe threads were tapered the wrong way to install the draincock into the tank. Retapping the fitting the right direction seemed to be a good fix for that problem.\nWhen I finally got around to attaching the wing to the fuselage, I found that the front spar attach fittings were badly misaligned. Although they could be forced into alignment, I didn't think I needed that kind of preload on the main spar fittings. This problem was fixed by calling on my local neighborhood machinist to build me an aligning fixture and reaming the attach holes to the next larger size and ordering the new sized bolts.\nOn the fuselage I found that although it had new Cleveland wheels and brakes on it, one of the brakes had a severe wobble to it. I must complement the manufacturers for taking care of that problem. One call to the Cleveland factory and they shipped me a new set of wheels and brakes even though the receipt for this set was over four years old and in the original builders name. Their only concern was that this set had never been placed in service yet.",
                "At each station, start by marking off each short (bottom longeron) line distance from the centerline. Use your set of trammels or beam compass for doing this. Mark the intersection of the short line with the station line.\nAt each station, mark off each long (top longeron) line distance from the intersection of the short line distance and the station line. Again the trammels or beam compass is best for completing this step. Mark the intersection of the long line distance with the station line.\nUsing the longeron as a batten, trace out the inside and outside curves of the longeron. After the batten is secure, in between each station, fasten a keeper block inside and outside to preserve the shape of the longeron taking care to avoid potential future interference with the diagonal members to be installed later. The fairing blocks can be removed or left in place if they won't interfere with building. The vertical station members and their diagonals can now be measured and positioned. Remember to refer to the plans for the material thickness direction.\nAfter vertical and diagonal members are cut and fitted, take time to draw their outlines on the building surface to cut down on time and confusion when laying out the opposite side.\nFinishing the side panel is accomplished in a manner similar to that called for in the handbook with the exception that the side and bottom skin panels will be attached later.\nThe next article in the series will discuss jigging and building techniques to ensure alignment and straightness of the flat built side panels. Also covered will be building a \"strongback\" jig to assure alignment of the side panels when they are formed into their final shape.\nPart 3 in the series will cover assembly of the side panels using the jigs. Some joint details will be discussed that will ensure a stronger and more fair fuselage assembly. Also covered will be the layout & attachment of the side and bottom ply skins.\nU.S. Mail: Densmore Associates, inc.\nANSI \"D\" size, computer generated plots of all the layout drawings in this series are available from the author for $30 plus postage & handling. Full (true size) scale plots may be made available depending on demand.",
                "I'm sure that many that are reading this could see several of the potential problems before I mentioned them, but some others may not have and I'm sure that there could have been many other problems that didn't but could have existed on this project. This is also not intended to be critical of the gentleman that started this project as many parts of it, especially the wood work are better than I could have done and much of his work is outstanding. I prefer to think that I'll end up with a better plane with his woodwork combined with my glasswork. This article is intended to feature some of the problems that you may run into in buying someone else's project.\nThe final question is, knowing what I have found over the past year, would I have still purchased this project. The answer is yes, but primarily because the price was right in that I am still money and work ahead of where I would be if I had started the project from scratch. There are a few things that I would have done differently, but nothing that I can't live with. Although I won't be able to say that I built it all from scratch, I have built and rebuild enough of the plane that I should have no problem qualifying under the 51% rule.\nYou can send comments directly to the author via e-mail at \"jscott@LANL.GOV\".\nHere is an brief explanation of how I built my turtledecks. The jig was constructed from scrap plywood and a few 1x4s that I ripped into stringers. I made two temporary bulkheads from the plywood, one for each end. Remember the forward bulkhead needs to be shaped in a way that will closely match the aft end of your canopy frame. Make an aft bulkhead by placing a straight edge at the top of your forward bulkhead and the trailing edge of your horizontal stabilizer. This will give you an idea of how tall your aft bulkhead needs to be. As far as location, I placed my aft bulkhead just forward of the lower/front of my vertical fin. I constructed the jig on the fuselage, it is glued together with automotive bondo.",
                "This year's KR Forum featured guest speakers Mike Stearns, Steve Trentman, and Bill Marcey. Mike Stearns spoke on several topics, including the many sources for KR and homebuilding information available on the Internet. He also mentioned KRNet, the list server devoted entirely to KR aircraft, as well as several notable World Wide Web home pages. He also brought a sample of the new Rand Robinson wing skins with him, and discussed their high temperature core prepreg construction. His KR2S will receive the first set, which is currently being installed at Hinson Composites.\nSteve Trentman spoke on his turbine installation. It uses a turbine engine which saw duty as an A7 attack jet starter engine. Total weight is about 85 pounds, while putting out around 90 horsepower. There is a small stockpile of these engines available from government surplus. sources. This engine can only be throttled back to 52% power, which leads to some pretty interesting landings. One inflight failure has been logged so far, with very little damage to the aircraft. More on this exciting development in next month's issue of KROnline.\nLes Palmer's KR2 N202LP won Best KR2, Best Engine Installation, and People's Choice awards at the 1995 KR Gathering at Columbia, TN. After researching the KR series, and reading Neil Bingham's \"A Critical Analysis of the KR2\" (Jan 88 Sport Aviation), Les decided to build his as a single seater, stretched 24\" in the tail, while maintaining a stock width firewall. His fuselage is made from Douglas fir, which weighs in at 4 lbs heavier than if constructed from spruce. It is skinned with 1/8\" birch plywood. Spars are covered with plywoood on both fore and aft sides, ala KR2S. Diehl wing skins provide the lift. Horizontal stabilizer and elevator were stretched 7\" longer on each side, while the vertical stabilizer and rudder were stretched 8\" taller. . The fuselage to cowling junction was made more graceful by adding 1.5 inches to the height of the firewall end of the fuselage sides.\nLes's canopy is a Dragonfly, using a four linkage system to swing forward when opening. The canopy frame fits snugly into a recess in the foward deck, providing an excellent wind and water seal. The fiberglass work is exemplary.\nSeating is luxurious for one.",
                "\"Scarfing\" is the practice of splicing plywood so that short pieces of plywood can be used to span long distances. On the KR, it is required on both the fuselage skins and spar webs. The angle of the splice should be 10 to 12 degrees to maintain strength across the joint. Also, joints should coincide with structural members, such as spar webs or fuselage truss members.\nThis scarfer is made by mating a regular plunge router (this one costs about $50) to a table saw. Obviously, you really only need a table saw to cut the chamfer, but it does make a nice heavy table for scarfing. You could just as easily use a large work table as the base.First, set the table saw for a 5.5 degree cut (for a 1:12 joint, or 6.5 degree cut for a 10:1 joint), and run a 1 x 6 through on edge to chamfer a corner on the board. Then drill the board for three router mounting holes (two are countersunk) and connect the assembly to the table saw with two 1/4 inch bolts. Use a long (2-3 inch) straight cutting bit to do the cutting. Adjust the bit so it doesn't interfere with your table top, and go to town. Keep pressure on the plywood to ensure contact with the table while you're scarfing. Make sure you feed your material from the same end as you would if you were sawing, or the router will take your plywood away from you and put a big dent in your garage door.\nIn the late 60's Ken Rand and Stuart Robinson were working as flight system engineers for Douglas Avionics. Ken was working as an electrical engineer, having previously worked for Sperry as an autopilots project engineer, while Stu's degree was in aeronautical engineering from Northrop University. They were two of the guys at the end of the DC-8,9, and 10 assembly lines responsible for correcting some of the nits and picks in various systems before delivery to the customer.",
                "The cowling is also a work of art, and uses NACA ducts for efficiency. Female molds were made for all the fiberglass parts on Les's plane, so he could proabably be persuaded to make more, if demand dictates. Les also machines a multitude of KR aluminum and steel parts which he now offers for sale.\nThe firewall was reinforced with aluminum brackets and angles bolted between the longerons in anticipation of the 200 lb Subaru EA-81 engine installation. His 100 HP Asian version is outfitted with an American Holley 5200 caburetor and manifold. It uses a PSRU of Les's own design, featuring two spur gears with a 1.69:1 reduction ratio and a toothed belt. Other than tapping the crank for larger bolts to mount the redrive, no other engine modifications were required. Also, this is probably the only air conditioned KR2 on the planet. The prop is a 60/63 Hegy.\nOriginally built as a taildragger, the fixed gear is made from 4130 steel tubing. Custom cast 6.00x6 aluminum wheels and steel rotors are mated with 6\" Cleveland calipers for braking. An early taxi test accident damaged the main gear, and prompted Les to change to tricycle gear. Again, he designed his own fiberglass main gear, and uses a Diehl nose wheel fork with a 4130 strut and 6\" wheel up front.\nEarly tests revealed cooling problems, which prompted a radiator move from the firewall to a lower cowling location.\nThe first flight was almost a disaster, as test pilot Randy Smith lost power right after takeoff. He managed a 180 with a safe downwind landing with only minor nosewheel pant damage. The culprit proved to be a spark plug with too much reach, which was quickly remedied. Subsequent flights have shown water temp to be about 210 degrees, oil temp is 220-230, and airspeed is about 180 mph.\nShopping for the Partially Built KR.\nThis story starts about twenty years ago when I first started looking at the KR-2 as the plane I'd like to build. The only problem at that time was a lack of money, lack of knowledge, and a lack of job stability. I liked the design, except for the low ground clearance of the retractable gear and that a KR was going to be a tight fit for me to fly.",
                "Layout to ensure a fair and true fuselage starts by drawing a reference line (baseline) on the building surface. Refer to figures 2 & 3 and use a wire guide to draw a very straight baseline. About 500 lbs. Of tension should be adequate. One could use a chalk line, but we're talking airplanes here, not house framing.\nThe main layout difference is that the baseline isn't used as a reference for the top longeron. The baseline references the mid point of the firewall for the developed (and true dimensioned) side panel. Although the baseline will still be the reference, the top and bottom longerons will be laid separately.\nLayout differences don't end there. Each of the stations (vertical members) will be laid out with a calculated separation so that when the panels are formed into position, they land on the spacing called for in the plans. Another major difference is that the bottom & side panels are applied after forming the fuselage box section. This is mainly to obtain the ability to \"fair\" the side and bottom surfaces and insure a straight and true shape.\nRefer to figure 1 for the layout of the new developed side panel. The firewall (station a) is layed out perpendicular to the baseline. Longitudinal (station) measurements are given along the length of the baseline from the firewall. Vertical dimensions are given to reference the angle and breadths of the station at the baseline.\nNotice that the top longeron is bowed outward and that the stations are spaced slightly greater than called out in the plans. When the panels are formed into the box frame section ,they will work into the dimensions specified in the plans.\nStrike a centerline, longer than is needed on the building surface using a wire guide. Draw off the firewall line perpendicular to the centerline at one end.\nUsing the distances listed in the balloons, mark them off on the centerline. Distances are measured to the nearest sixteenth of an inch. Take time to mark them off carefully. Don't mark off the distances in a cumulative fashion. Use the firewall as a common reference.\nUsing the angles listed at each station, mark off a station line longer than is needed. The angles are measured to the nearest hundredth of a degree. Take time to mark them off carefully.",
                "Second, understand that the dimensions called for in the plans put a twist in the sides that tends to work the panel in two directions of curvature. This twist makes the panel \"undevelopable\" meaning that that shape cannot be unrolled into an equivalent flat shape. This is important when laying out the side and bottom panels onto flat plywood. To illustrate this, try forming a piece of paper around a soda can. The paper can be formed flat around the can either straight or at a diagonal to it's length. It has only one direction of curvature and is by definition \"developable\". Now try to form the same piece of paper around a baseball. It won't lie flat on the surface without some deformation (folding, wrinkling or tearing) of the paper. The ball has curvature in more that one direction and is a \"compounded\" shape. Paper (or plywood) can only be readily formed in developable shapes as opposed to aluminum or other metal which can accept in plane deformation. A developable surface is needed to lay out a curved surface when the materials used can't be deformed with any degree of in-plane strain.\nInitially, the fuselage sides are laid out flat with reference to the top longeron measured to a straight chalk line. The bowing problem starts when the side panels are bent and sloped to form the fuselage box section. If the sides were not sloped (tumbled home), the section formed would be cylindrical and the longerons would lie flat. Since the sides are tumbled home, the section formed is now conical. When a conical shape is cut with a plane (building surface) not perpendicular to it's axis, the shape formed is elliptical -- exactly what happens with the top longeron. When it's built flat, bent to form a cylindrical section, and sloped to form a conical section, it takes on an elliptical shape firewall to tailstock.\nThis method borrows heavily from proven techniques used in the marine trades. It should be stressed at this point that although the layout procedure is not complicated, it is important to take your time. If the layout is not going well initially, start over! Better to erase layout errors now than to have them built it and cause surprises later.",
                "I also found a small linear crack in the lower left wing spar cap on the left wing stub. It appeared to be from over tightening the rear spar wing attach fitting bolts. His explanation was that the crack wasn't important because the rear spars only job is to keep the wings from folding back. I also noticed that the holes for attaching the outer wing to the wing stub were badly rounded out on the rear spar. He explained that the Diehl wing skins require the rear spar to be swept slightly more forward than the stock wings. This won't allow you to use the rear spar attach fittings from RR and that I would need to fabricate a new set of rear spar attach fittings.\nI also found that the aileron bellcranks were not built or installed as per plans, but found that they looked professional. I couldn't check for function since the right bellcrank and sheeve wasn't installed, the left wing also wasn't installed, and the right wing didn't exist yet.\nNext we pulled the inspection panels off of the fuselage and tail and looked at everything I could see with a good flashlight. I didn't find anything else that might be questionable about the fuselage except for a cracked elevator trim tab that was damaged when it fell off it's hanging place on the wall.\nNext we spent some time going over his builders log and builders photo album. I still hadn't seen anything that would dissuade me from buying this project.",
                "They both wanted to build a fast, inexpensive airplane which was also economical to maintain. Several designs were considered, and plans were bought first for the Jeanie's Teenie and then the Taylor Monoplane. The Monoplane was more to their liking, but would require some modification to fit their needs. A cooperative redesign effort ensued, with virtually no dimensions left untouched. Only the basic fuselage structure, airfoil, and powerplant were retained. The tail shape was Stu's, and came directly from the big DC-8s parked on the ramp outside his office window. The landing gear was designed by Ken, after seeing the gear on a Dewey Bird at Santa Paula airport.\nKen was killed in his KR2 a short time later while flying over Cajon Pass in what was apparently a bad weather / low fuel accident. Ken's wife Jeanette became owner of RR overnight, and stepped up to keep the plans and parts coming. Much of the engineering needs are handled by Bill Marcy of Denver, who's been helping out since early '79.\nTo date, almost 6000 KR1, 9200 KR2, and 760 KR2S plan sets have been sold. 1200 KR2s are estimated to be flying, with 5 KR2Ss now in the air. Much of the development work done on KR's is now done by the builders themselves. KR builders tend to be innovative, which leads to some interesting modifications. Some of the mods that work eventually creep into the plans. The KR2S is a case in point. Many builders who'd heard of the pitch sensitivity and tight cabin of the KR2 began to build an enlarged version, with the length determined by the most commonly available longeron material. The result is a KR2 that is stretched 2\" between firewall and main spar, and 14\" behind the main spar. Higher gross weights dictated more wing area, with the new standard becoming the Diehl wing skin. Those who plan to carry passengers commonly stretch the cabin width a few inches, although 1.5 inches is the limit if you still want to use RR's premolded parts.\nMike Stearns addresses the KR Forum crowd.",
                "After the bulkheads were bondoed to the fuselage I used the stringers that I ripped from the 1x4s and bondoed them to the bulkheads. This gave me a male form to cover with thin plastic or posterboard. I stapled two layers of posterboard to the jig(thin plastic would work better). The posterboard wraps down two inches onto the fuselage. After I was satisfied with the way it looked, I then covered the entire thing with duct tape (fiberglass will not stick to duct tape) On top of this I wetout one layer of tri-ply cloth (22oz) that I had left over from an earlier project, and one layer of 8oz. bid. Remember to mask off your fuselage so you don't get epoxy on it. If you are not familiar with composite lay-ups, you should plan on razor cutting your lay-ups 4 to 6 hours after wetout while the lay-up is still soft enough to cut with a razorblade.\nAfter the lay-up cured (2 or 3 days) it was removed from the jig, and the jig was removed from the fuselage and discarded. (be careful, the bondo sticks very well to the spruce, you could splinter your wood during removal) I now have a fiberglass skin that tends to hold the shape of the jig but is still flexible enough to work with. I made two bulkheads out of 1/4 last-a-foam (AS&S) using the plywood formers from the jig as a guide. I covered these foam bulkheads with one 8oz layer of glass on each side, with a glass to glass edge on the bottom. After cure these bulkheads were bondoed into place (to the fuselage)and the fiberglass skin was pulled down tight and floxed to the bulkheads. When the flox cured the bondo joints were broken, again being careful not to harm the wood. The turtledeck was removed from the fuselage and 2 inch tapes added to the bulkheads inside and out.",
                "Probably one of the most frustrating things about building experimental aircraft, especially when starting with a minimum of pre-fabricated parts, is to start building and ending up with an unexpected result. Every builder starts a new project by wanting it to go \"perfectly.\" So when things aren't going well, especially at the beginning, the frustration can lead to an unfinished airplane.\nThis is the first article in a series dedicated to helping builders of the Rand Robinson KR series planes build a straight and true fuselage -- the first part of the construction process. Borrowing from modern boatbuliding techniques, focus will be on the KR-2S, but the principles apply to the entire lineup of KR-1 & KR-2 series planes.\nWhile building the KR-2(s) a common surprise is encountered by builders when the completed fuselage sides are laid into position to form the fuselage box section. With many hours spent building the sides flat, finding the once straight longerons that now bow up from the building surface, form a most dissatisfying \"banana\" shape. Especially when using the preformed fiberglass parts, this curve in the top longeron is not acceptable. The builder is left wondering what went wrong and no amount of clamping or brute force forming will solve the problem to any degree of satisfaction. The problem is not the builder's fault. The solution starts by understanding the three dimensional relationship of the assembled parts being built.\nFirst understand that the plans show the finished form of the plane. They show the \"projected\" form as you would expect to see it if viewing an actual plane from the top, ends and from the side. Since the sides are sloped (flared) outward, looking from the side, the distances given by measuring the profile drawing are \"foreshortened\" and don't give the proper shape for building the fuselage with a flat top longeron. What needs to be done is to \"develop\" the \"true\" distances and shape of the flat panel so that when it is curved into position, the longerons lay flat."

Stearns discussed Internet resources for KR aircraft, showcased new wing skins, and mentioned his KR2S being fitted with them. Trentman presented on his turbine engine installation, which is a lightweight, high-power engine from an A7 attack jet, with one in-flight failure reported.

The engine is equipped with a Holley carburetor, a PSRU with a 1.69:1 reduction ratio, and is air-conditioned. Originally a taildragger, it now has tricycle gear with custom aluminum wheels and Cleveland calipers. Cooling issues led to a radiator relocation, and an early flight test had a near-disaster due to a spark plug issue, but subsequent flights showed stable performance.

After discovering Roy Marsh's KR-2S in \"KITPLANES,\" the author decided to build one, ordering plans and materials from Rand Robinson. However, after finding a partially completed KR-2S for sale, the author initially resisted but eventually reconsidered due to budget constraints, deciding to investigate the purchase.",
                        "The author, experienced in airplane construction, visited a seller's project 400 miles away. They inspected the fuselage, finding it well-built with precise glasswork and careful interior assembly, but noted a swelling issue in the horizontal stabilizers due to exposure to the sun. The seller suggested repairing it with micro, but the author has since had to address this and other overlooked issues after purchasing the project.",
                        "The inspection revealed a small linear crack in the lower left wing spar cap, likely caused by overtightening the rear spar wing attach fitting bolts. The builder explained that the crack was not critical as the rear spars primarily prevent the wings from folding back. Additionally, the holes for attaching the outer wing to the wing stub were rounded out on the rear spar, requiring new rear spar attach fittings due to the Diehl wing skins' design. The aileron bellcranks were not built or installed as per plans but appeared professionally done, though function could not be assessed due to incomplete assembly. The fuselage inspection found a cracked elevator trim tab, damaged when it fell off the wall. Reviewing the builder's log and photo album did not raise any concerns that would deter purchasing the project.",

They did a brief inspection of the wings and canopy, finding minor issues but nothing alarming. Believing they could fix any major problems and still come out ahead financially, they agreed to buy the project. They acknowledge potential oversight due to lack of local expertise in fiberglass, but later discovered several issues over the year, some due to ignorance and others from not inspecting closely enough. They then list some of the problems found and their corresponding fixes.",

Additionally, the aileron bellcrank setup on the right side wing was found to be non-functional due to cable tension issues and interference with the rear wing attach fittings. These problems necessitated a major redesign or replacement of the rear spar and aileron system, highlighting the severity of the issues encountered during the inspection.",

They address these problems by sanding and rebuilding the leading edge, varnishing the woodwork, retapping the drain fitting, creating an aligning fixture for the spar fittings, and receiving a replacement set of wheels and brakes from the manufacturer.",
                        "The author sanded the micro off the left wing to reveal a missing glass section in front of the aileron hinge, caused by a mismeasurement. They filled the gap with spruce and reinforced the trailing edge with glass. They also found a damaged trim tab with a floxed hinge and reinforced its front with glass. The author inspected the canopy, finding it slightly lopsided and too thin, making it potentially unsafe on warm days. The canopy needs to be replaced.",

The author also shares a brief explanation of how they built turtledecks using a jig made from scrap plywood and 1x4s, emphasizing the importance of shaping the bulkheads to match the canopy frame and stabilizer. They invite comments via email and express satisfaction with combining their glasswork with the original woodwork to create a better final product.",
                        "After attaching bulkheads to the fuselage with bondo, stringers were added to create a male form for covering. Two layers of posterboard were stapled to the form, and the entire structure was covered with duct tape. A layer of tri-ply cloth and an 8oz bid were then applied, followed by careful cutting and curing. The fiberglass skin was removed from the jig and discarded, leaving a flexible yet shape-holding skin. Foam bulkheads were created using the jig's plywood formers as a guide, and were covered with glass on both sides. These bulkheads were bondoed into place, and the fiberglass skin was secured with flox. After curing, the bondo joints were broken, and 2-inch tapes were added to the bulkheads inside and out.",
                        "The turtledeck was lightweight and looked good, but had a deformable skin. To reinforce it, the author added composite stringers made from 1/4-inch last-a-foam strips, creating three stringers: one central and two on either side. The edges were sanded for a smooth transition, and the stringers were glued in with micro and covered with an 8oz bid layer at 45 degrees."

                "Current causes several observable effects, which historically were the means of recognising its presence. That water could be decomposed by the current from a voltaic pile was discovered by Nicholson and Carlisle in 1800, a process now known as electrolysis. Their work was greatly expanded upon by Michael Faraday in 1833. Current through a resistance causes localised heating, an effect James Prescott Joule studied mathematically in 1840.:23\u201324 One of the most important discoveries relating to current was made accidentally by Hans Christian \u00d8rsted in 1820, when, while preparing a lecture, he witnessed the current in a wire disturbing the needle of a magnetic compass. He had discovered electromagnetism, a fundamental interaction between electricity and magnetics. The level of electromagnetic emissions generated by electric arcing is high enough to produce electromagnetic interference, which can be detrimental to the workings of adjacent equipment.\nIn engineering or household applications, current is often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative.:11 If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this takes the form of a sine wave.:206\u201307 Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance.:223\u201325 These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.",
                "The concept of the electric field was introduced by Michael Faraday. An electric field is created by a charged body in the space that surrounds it, and results in a force exerted on any other charges placed within the field. The electric field acts between two charges in a similar manner to the way that the gravitational field acts between two masses, and like it, extends towards infinity and shows an inverse square relationship with distance. However, there is an important difference. Gravity always acts in attraction, drawing two masses together, while the electric field can result in either attraction or repulsion. Since large bodies such as planets generally carry no net charge, the electric field at a distance is usually zero. Thus gravity is the dominant force at distance in the universe, despite being much weaker.\nA hollow conducting body carries all its charge on its outer surface. The field is therefore zero at all places inside the body.:88 This is the operating principal of the Faraday cage, a conducting metal shell which isolates its interior from outside electrical effects.\nThe principles of electrostatics are important when designing items of high-voltage equipment. There is a finite limit to the electric field strength that may be withstood by any medium. Beyond this point, electrical breakdown occurs and an electric arc causes flashover between the charged parts. Air, for example, tends to arc across small gaps at electric field strengths which exceed 30 kV per centimetre. Over larger gaps, its breakdown strength is weaker, perhaps 1 kV per centimetre. The most visible natural occurrence of this is lightning, caused when charge becomes separated in the clouds by rising columns of air, and raises the electric field in the air to greater than it can withstand. The voltage of a large lightning cloud may be as high as 100 MV and have discharge energies as great as 250 kWh.\nA pair of AA cells. The + sign indicates the polarity of the potential difference between the battery terminals.",
                "Electricity generation is often done with electric generators, but can also be supplied by chemical sources such as electric batteries or by other means from a wide variety of sources of energy. Electric power is generally supplied to businesses and homes by the electric power industry. Electricity is usually sold by the kilowatt hour (3.6 MJ) which is the product of power in kilowatts multiplied by running time in hours. Electric utilities measure power using electricity meters, which keep a running total of the electric energy delivered to a customer. Unlike fossil fuels, electricity is a low entropy form of energy and can be converted into motion or many other forms of energy with high efficiency.\nElectronics deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes, optoelectronics, sensors and integrated circuits, and associated passive interconnection technologies. The nonlinear behaviour of active components and their ability to control electron flows makes amplification of weak signals possible and electronics is widely used in information processing, telecommunications, and signal processing. The ability of electronic devices to act as switches makes digital information processing possible. Interconnection technologies such as circuit boards, electronics packaging technology, and other varied forms of communication infrastructure complete circuit functionality and transform the mixed components into a regular working system.\nToday, most electronic devices use semiconductor components to perform electron control. The study of semiconductor devices and related technology is considered a branch of solid state physics, whereas the design and construction of electronic circuits to solve practical problems come under electronics engineering.\nThus, the work of many researchers enabled the use of electronics to convert signals into high frequency oscillating currents, and via suitably shaped conductors, electricity permits the transmission and reception of these signals via radio waves over very long distances.\nEarly 20th-century alternator made in Budapest, Hungary, in the power generating hall of a hydroelectric station (photograph by Prokudin-Gorsky, 1905\u20131915).",

                "Long before any knowledge of electricity existed, people were aware of shocks from electric fish. Ancient Egyptian texts dating from 2750 BCE referred to these fish as the \"Thunderer of the Nile\", and described them as the \"protectors\" of all other fish. Electric fish were again reported millennia later by ancient Greek, Roman and Arabic naturalists and physicians. Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients suffering from ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them. Possibly the earliest and nearest approach to the discovery of the identity of lightning, and electricity from any other source, is to be attributed to the Arabs, who before the 15th century had the Arabic word for lightning ra\u2018ad (\u0631\u0639\u062f) applied to the electric ray.\nAncient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing. Thales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature.\nBenjamin Franklin conducted extensive research on electricity in the 18th century, as documented by Joseph Priestley (1767) History and Present Status of Electricity, with whom Franklin carried on extended correspondence.",
                "Some organisms, such as sharks, are able to detect and respond to changes in electric fields, an ability known as electroreception, while others, termed electrogenic, are able to generate voltages themselves to serve as a predatory or defensive weapon. The order Gymnotiformes, of which the best known example is the electric eel, detect or stun their prey via high voltages generated from modified muscle cells called electrocytes. All animals transmit information along their cell membranes with voltage pulses called action potentials, whose functions include communication by the nervous system between neurons and muscles. An electric shock stimulates this system, and causes muscles to contract. Action potentials are also responsible for coordinating activities in certain plants.\nIn the 19th and early 20th century, electricity was not part of the everyday life of many people, even in the industrialised Western world. The popular culture of the time accordingly often depicted it as a mysterious, quasi-magical force that can slay the living, revive the dead or otherwise bend the laws of nature. This attitude began with the 1771 experiments of Luigi Galvani in which the legs of dead frogs were shown to twitch on application of animal electricity. \"Revitalization\" or resuscitation of apparently dead or drowned persons was reported in the medical literature shortly after Galvani's work. These results were known to Mary Shelley when she authored Frankenstein (1819), although she does not name the method of revitalization of the monster. The revitalization of monsters with electricity later became a stock theme in horror films.\nAs the public familiarity with electricity as the lifeblood of the Second Industrial Revolution grew, its wielders were more often cast in a positive light, such as the workers who \"finger death at their gloves' end as they piece and repiece the living wires\" in Rudyard Kipling's 1907 poem Sons of Martha. Electrically powered vehicles of every sort featured large in adventure stories such as those of Jules Verne and the Tom Swift books.

                "Electricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist William Gilbert wrote De Magnete, in which he made a careful study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber. He coined the New Latin word electricus (\"of amber\" or \"like amber\", from \u1f24\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, elektron, the Greek word for \"amber\") to refer to the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed. This association gave rise to the English words \"electric\" and \"electricity\", which made their first appearance in print in Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica of 1646.\nFurther work was conducted in the 17th and early 18th centuries by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. Later in the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key to the bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges.\nIn 1791, Luigi Galvani published his discovery of bioelectromagnetics, demonstrating that electricity was the medium by which neurons passed signals to the muscles. Alessandro Volta's battery, or voltaic pile, of 1800, made from alternating layers of zinc and copper, provided scientists with a more reliable source of electrical energy than the electrostatic machines previously used. The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian \u00d8rsted and Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re in 1819\u20131820. Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821, and Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827. Electricity and magnetism (and light) were definitively linked by James Clerk Maxwell, in particular in his \"On Physical Lines of Force\" in 1861 and 1862.",
                "Electricity is a very convenient way to transfer energy, and it has been adapted to a huge, and growing, number of uses. The invention of a practical incandescent light bulb in the 1870s led to lighting becoming one of the first publicly available applications of electrical power. Although electrification brought with it its own dangers, replacing the naked flames of gas lighting greatly reduced fire hazards within homes and factories. Public utilities were set up in many cities targeting the burgeoning market for electrical lighting. In the late 20th century and in modern times, the trend has started to flow in the direction of deregulation in the electrical power sector.\nThe resistive Joule heating effect employed in filament light bulbs also sees more direct use in electric heating. While this is versatile and controllable, it can be seen as wasteful, since most electrical generation has already required the production of heat at a power station. A number of countries, such as Denmark, have issued legislation restricting or banning the use of resistive electric heating in new buildings. Electricity is however still a highly practical energy source for heating and refrigeration, with air conditioning/heat pumps representing a growing sector for electricity demand for heating and cooling, the effects of which electricity utilities are increasingly obliged to accommodate.\nElectricity is used within telecommunications, and indeed the electrical telegraph, demonstrated commercially in 1837 by Cooke and Wheatstone, was one of its earliest applications. With the construction of first intercontinental, and then transatlantic, telegraph systems in the 1860s, electricity had enabled communications in minutes across the globe. Optical fibre and satellite communication have taken a share of the market for communications systems, but electricity can be expected to remain an essential part of the process.\nThe effects of electromagnetism are most visibly employed in the electric motor, which provides a clean and efficient means of motive power. A stationary motor such as a winch is easily provided with a supply of power, but a motor that moves with its application, such as an electric vehicle, is obliged to either carry along a power source such as a battery, or to collect current from a sliding contact such as a pantograph. Electrically powered vehicles are used in public transportation, such as electric buses and trains, and an increasing number of battery-powered electric cars in private ownership.",
                "\u00d8rsted's discovery in 1821 that a magnetic field existed around all sides of a wire carrying an electric current indicated that there was a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism. Moreover, the interaction seemed different from gravitational and electrostatic forces, the two forces of nature then known. The force on the compass needle did not direct it to or away from the current-carrying wire, but acted at right angles to it. \u00d8rsted's slightly obscure words were that \"the electric conflict acts in a revolving manner.\" The force also depended on the direction of the current, for if the flow was reversed, then the force did too.\n\u00d8rsted did not fully understand his discovery, but he observed the effect was reciprocal: a current exerts a force on a magnet, and a magnetic field exerts a force on a current. The phenomenon was further investigated by Amp\u00e8re, who discovered that two parallel current-carrying wires exerted a force upon each other: two wires conducting currents in the same direction are attracted to each other, while wires containing currents in opposite directions are forced apart. The interaction is mediated by the magnetic field each current produces and forms the basis for the international definition of the ampere.\nThis relationship between magnetic fields and currents is extremely important, for it led to Michael Faraday's invention of the electric motor in 1821. Faraday's homopolar motor consisted of a permanent magnet sitting in a pool of mercury. A current was allowed through a wire suspended from a pivot above the magnet and dipped into the mercury. The magnet exerted a tangential force on the wire, making it circle around the magnet for as long as the current was maintained.",
                "For other uses, see Electricity (disambiguation).\n\"Electric\" redirects here. For other uses, see Electric (disambiguation).\nLightning is one of the most dramatic effects of electricity.\nElectricity is the set of physical phenomena associated with the presence and motion of matter that has a property of electric charge. In early days, electricity was considered as being not related to magnetism. Later on, many experimental results and the development of Maxwell's equations indicated that both electricity and magnetism are from a single phenomenon: electromagnetism. Various common phenomena are related to electricity, including lightning, static electricity, electric heating, electric discharges and many others.\nThe presence of an electric charge, which can be either positive or negative, produces an electric field. The movement of electric charges is an electric current and produces a magnetic field.\nWhen a charge is placed in a location with a non-zero electric field, a force will act on it. The magnitude of this force is given by Coulomb's law. Thus, if that charge were to move, the electric field would be doing work on the electric charge. Thus we can speak of electric potential at a certain point in space, which is equal to the work done by an external agent in carrying a unit of positive charge from an arbitrarily chosen reference point to that point without any acceleration and is typically measured in volts.\nelectronics which deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes and integrated circuits, and associated passive interconnection technologies.\nElectrical phenomena have been studied since antiquity, though progress in theoretical understanding remained slow until the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Even then, practical applications for electricity were few, and it would not be until the late nineteenth century that electrical engineers were able to put it to industrial and residential use. The rapid expansion in electrical technology at this time transformed industry and society, becoming a driving force for the Second Industrial Revolution. Electricity's extraordinary versatility means it can be put to an almost limitless set of applications which include transport, heating, lighting, communications, and computation. Electrical power is now the backbone of modern industrial society.",
                "In the 6th century BC, the Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus experimented with amber rods and these experiments were the first studies into the production of electrical energy. While this method, now known as the triboelectric effect, can lift light objects and generate sparks, it is extremely inefficient. It was not until the invention of the voltaic pile in the eighteenth century that a viable source of electricity became available. The voltaic pile, and its modern descendant, the electrical battery, store energy chemically and make it available on demand in the form of electrical energy. The battery is a versatile and very common power source which is ideally suited to many applications, but its energy storage is finite, and once discharged it must be disposed of or recharged. For large electrical demands electrical energy must be generated and transmitted continuously over conductive transmission lines.\nElectrical power is usually generated by electro-mechanical generators driven by steam produced from fossil fuel combustion, or the heat released from nuclear reactions; or from other sources such as kinetic energy extracted from wind or flowing water. The modern steam turbine invented by Sir Charles Parsons in 1884 today generates about 80 percent of the electric power in the world using a variety of heat sources. Such generators bear no resemblance to Faraday's homopolar disc generator of 1831, but they still rely on his electromagnetic principle that a conductor linking a changing magnetic field induces a potential difference across its ends. The invention in the late nineteenth century of the transformer meant that electrical power could be transmitted more efficiently at a higher voltage but lower current. Efficient electrical transmission meant in turn that electricity could be generated at centralised power stations, where it benefited from economies of scale, and then be despatched relatively long distances to where it was needed.\nSince electrical energy cannot easily be stored in quantities large enough to meet demands on a national scale, at all times exactly as much must be produced as is required. This requires electricity utilities to make careful predictions of their electrical loads, and maintain constant co-ordination with their power stations. A certain amount of generation must always be held in reserve to cushion an electrical grid against inevitable disturbances and losses.",
                "The presence of charge gives rise to an electrostatic force: charges exert a force on each other, an effect that was known, though not understood, in antiquity.:457 A lightweight ball suspended from a string can be charged by touching it with a glass rod that has itself been charged by rubbing with a cloth. If a similar ball is charged by the same glass rod, it is found to repel the first: the charge acts to force the two balls apart. Two balls that are charged with a rubbed amber rod also repel each other. However, if one ball is charged by the glass rod, and the other by an amber rod, the two balls are found to attract each other. These phenomena were investigated in the late eighteenth century by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, who deduced that charge manifests itself in two opposing forms. This discovery led to the well-known axiom: like-charged objects repel and opposite-charged objects attract.\nThe force acts on the charged particles themselves, hence charge has a tendency to spread itself as evenly as possible over a conducting surface. The magnitude of the electromagnetic force, whether attractive or repulsive, is given by Coulomb's law, which relates the force to the product of the charges and has an inverse-square relation to the distance between them.:35 The electromagnetic force is very strong, second only in strength to the strong interaction, but unlike that force it operates over all distances. In comparison with the much weaker gravitational force, the electromagnetic force pushing two electrons apart is 1042 times that of the gravitational attraction pulling them together.\nStudy has shown that the origin of charge is from certain types of subatomic particles which have the property of electric charge. Electric charge gives rise to and interacts with the electromagnetic force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature. The most familiar carriers of electrical charge are the electron and proton. Experiment has shown charge to be a conserved quantity, that is, the net charge within an electrically isolated system will always remain constant regardless of any changes taking place within that system. Within the system, charge may be transferred between bodies, either by direct contact, or by passing along a conducting material, such as a wire.:2\u20135 The informal term static electricity refers to the net presence (or 'imbalance') of charge on a body, usually caused when dissimilar materials are rubbed together, transferring charge from one to the other.",
                "While the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering. Through such people as Alexander Graham Bell, Ott\u00f3 Bl\u00e1thy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, \u00c1nyos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, electricity turned from a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life.\nIn 1887, Heinrich Hertz:843\u201344 discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily. In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets, energising electrons. This discovery led to the quantum revolution. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for \"his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". The photoelectric effect is also employed in photocells such as can be found in solar panels and this is frequently used to make electricity commercially.\nThe first solid-state device was the \"cat's-whisker detector\" first used in the 1900s in radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a germanium crystal) to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect. In a solid-state component, the current is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it. Current flow can be understood in two forms: as negatively charged electrons, and as positively charged electron deficiencies called holes. These charges and holes are understood in terms of quantum physics. The building material is most often a crystalline semiconductor.\nThe solid-state device came into its own with the invention of the transistor in 1947. Common solid-state devices include transistors, microprocessor chips, and RAM. A specialized type of RAM called flash RAM is used in USB flash drives and more recently, solid-state drives to replace mechanically rotating magnetic disc hard disk drives. Solid state devices became prevalent in the 1950s and the 1960s, during the transition from vacuum tubes to semiconductor diodes, transistors, integrated circuit (IC) and the light-emitting diode (LED).",
                "The concept of electric potential is closely linked to that of the electric field. A small charge placed within an electric field experiences a force, and to have brought that charge to that point against the force requires work. The electric potential at any point is defined as the energy required to bring a unit test charge from an infinite distance slowly to that point. It is usually measured in volts, and one volt is the potential for which one joule of work must be expended to bring a charge of one coulomb from infinity.:494\u201398 This definition of potential, while formal, has little practical application, and a more useful concept is that of electric potential difference, and is the energy required to move a unit charge between two specified points. An electric field has the special property that it is conservative, which means that the path taken by the test charge is irrelevant: all paths between two specified points expend the same energy, and thus a unique value for potential difference may be stated.:494\u201398 The volt is so strongly identified as the unit of choice for measurement and description of electric potential difference that the term voltage sees greater everyday usage.\nFor practical purposes, it is useful to define a common reference point to which potentials may be expressed and compared. While this could be at infinity, a much more useful reference is the Earth itself, which is assumed to be at the same potential everywhere. This reference point naturally takes the name earth or ground. Earth is assumed to be an infinite source of equal amounts of positive and negative charge, and is therefore electrically uncharged\u2014and unchargeable.\nElectric potential is a scalar quantity, that is, it has only magnitude and not direction. It may be viewed as analogous to height: just as a released object will fall through a difference in heights caused by a gravitational field, so a charge will 'fall' across the voltage caused by an electric field. As relief maps show contour lines marking points of equal height, a set of lines marking points of equal potential (known as equipotentials) may be drawn around an electrostatically charged object. The equipotentials cross all lines of force at right angles. They must also lie parallel to a conductor's surface, otherwise this would produce a force that will move the charge carriers to even the potential of the surface.",

                "Experimentation by Faraday in 1831 revealed that a wire moving perpendicular to a magnetic field developed a potential difference between its ends. Further analysis of this process, known as electromagnetic induction, enabled him to state the principle, now known as Faraday's law of induction, that the potential difference induced in a closed circuit is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux through the loop. Exploitation of this discovery enabled him to invent the first electrical generator in 1831, in which he converted the mechanical energy of a rotating copper disc to electrical energy. Faraday's disc was inefficient and of no use as a practical generator, but it showed the possibility of generating electric power using magnetism, a possibility that would be taken up by those that followed on from his work.\nItalian physicist Alessandro Volta showing his \"battery\" to French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte in the early 19th century.\nThe ability of chemical reactions to produce electricity, and conversely the ability of electricity to drive chemical reactions has a wide array of uses.\nElectrochemistry has always been an important part of electricity. From the initial invention of the Voltaic pile, electrochemical cells have evolved into the many different types of batteries, electroplating and electrolysis cells. Aluminium is produced in vast quantities this way, and many portable devices are electrically powered using rechargeable cells.\nA basic electric circuit. The voltage source V on the left drives a current I around the circuit, delivering electrical energy into the resistor R. From the resistor, the current returns to the source, completing the circuit.\nAn electric circuit is an interconnection of electric components such that electric charge is made to flow along a closed path (a circuit), usually to perform some useful task.\nElectric power is the rate at which electric energy is transferred by an electric circuit. The SI unit of power is the watt, one joule per second.",
                "The charge on electrons and protons is opposite in sign, hence an amount of charge may be expressed as being either negative or positive. By convention, the charge carried by electrons is deemed negative, and that by protons positive, a custom that originated with the work of Benjamin Franklin. The amount of charge is usually given the symbol Q and expressed in coulombs; each electron carries the same charge of approximately \u22121.6022\u00d710\u221219 coulomb. The proton has a charge that is equal and opposite, and thus +1.6022\u00d710\u221219 coulomb. Charge is possessed not just by matter, but also by antimatter, each antiparticle bearing an equal and opposite charge to its corresponding particle.\nThe movement of electric charge is known as an electric current, the intensity of which is usually measured in amperes. Current can consist of any moving charged particles; most commonly these are electrons, but any charge in motion constitutes a current. Electric current can flow through some things, electrical conductors, but will not flow through an electrical insulator.\nBy historical convention, a positive current is defined as having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called conventional current. The motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit, one of the most familiar forms of current, is thus deemed positive in the opposite direction to that of the electrons. However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction, or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation.\nThe process by which electric current passes through a material is termed electrical conduction, and its nature varies with that of the charged particles and the material through which they are travelling. Examples of electric currents include metallic conduction, where electrons flow through a conductor such as metal, and electrolysis, where ions (charged atoms) flow through liquids, or through plasmas such as electrical sparks. While the particles themselves can move quite slowly, sometimes with an average drift velocity only fractions of a millimetre per second,:17 the electric field that drives them itself propagates at close to the speed of light, enabling electrical signals to pass rapidly along wires.",
                "Electronic devices make use of the transistor, perhaps one of the most important inventions of the twentieth century, and a fundamental building block of all modern circuitry. A modern integrated circuit may contain several billion miniaturised transistors in a region only a few centimetres square.\nA voltage applied to a human body causes an electric current through the tissues, and although the relationship is non-linear, the greater the voltage, the greater the current. The threshold for perception varies with the supply frequency and with the path of the current, but is about 0.1 mA to 1 mA for mains-frequency electricity, though a current as low as a microamp can be detected as an electrovibration effect under certain conditions. If the current is sufficiently high, it will cause muscle contraction, fibrillation of the heart, and tissue burns. The lack of any visible sign that a conductor is electrified makes electricity a particular hazard. The pain caused by an electric shock can be intense, leading electricity at times to be employed as a method of torture. Death caused by an electric shock is referred to as electrocution. Electrocution is still the means of judicial execution in some jurisdictions, though its use has become rarer in recent times.\nElectricity is not a human invention, and may be observed in several forms in nature, a prominent manifestation of which is lightning. Many interactions familiar at the macroscopic level, such as touch, friction or chemical bonding, are due to interactions between electric fields on the atomic scale. The Earth's magnetic field is thought to arise from a natural dynamo of circulating currents in the planet's core. Certain crystals, such as quartz, or even sugar, generate a potential difference across their faces when subjected to external pressure. This phenomenon is known as piezoelectricity, from the Greek piezein (\u03c0\u03b9\u03ad\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd), meaning to press, and was discovered in 1880 by Pierre and Jacques Curie. The effect is reciprocal, and when a piezoelectric material is subjected to an electric field, a small change in physical dimensions takes place.\n\u00a7Bioelectrogenesis in microbial life is a prominent phenomenon in soils and sediment ecology resulting from anaerobic respiration.

The study of electricity dates back to antiquity, with early observations of electric fish and static electricity. Key figures like William Gilbert, Benjamin Franklin, and Alessandro Volta made significant contributions to understanding electricity and magnetism, leading to the development of devices such as the voltaic pile.\n\nThe late 19th and early 20th centuries saw transformative advancements in electrical engineering, driven by pioneers like Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla, and Alexander Graham Bell. These developments turned electricity from a scientific curiosity into a vital tool for modern life, powering industries, transportation, and communication. The discovery of the photoelectric effect by Albert Einstein and the invention of solid-state devices like transistors revolutionized electronics, leading to the digital age.\n\nElectricity is characterized by the presence of electric and magnetic fields, with charges exerting forces on each other according to Coulomb's law. Charge is a conserved quantity and can be transferred between bodies through contact or conduction. Electric current, the flow of electric charge, has observable effects such as electrolysis, heating, and the generation of magnetic fields. Current can be direct (DC) or alternating (AC), with AC periodically reversing direction and influenced by properties like inductance and capacitance.\n\nOverall, electricity's evolution from ancient observations to modern applications has profoundly impacted society, driving technological advancements and transforming industries.",
                    "The main themes covered in the summaries are as follows:\n\n1. **Electric Field and Electrostatics**:\n   - The electric field, introduced by Michael Faraday, is generated by charged bodies and exerts force on other charges, similar to gravity but with attraction or repulsion.\n   - Conducting bodies, like those in a Faraday cage, distribute charge on their outer surfaces, creating a zero field inside.\n   - Electrostatics principles are crucial in high-voltage equipment design, as exceeding a medium's electric field strength limit leads to electrical breakdown and potential hazards like lightning.\n\n2. **Electric Potential**:\n   - Electric potential is a measure of the energy required to bring a unit charge from infinity to a specific point within an electric field, typically measured in volts.\n   - The concept of electric potential difference is practical, as it quantifies the energy required to move a unit charge between two points.\n   - Electric fields are conservative, meaning the energy expended is path-independent, allowing for a unique potential difference between any two points.\n\n3. **Electromagnetism**:\n   - In 1821, \u00d8rsted discovered that a magnetic field surrounds a wire carrying an electric current, indicating a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism.\n   - Amp\u00e8re further explored this, finding that parallel currents attract if they flow in the same direction and repel if they flow in opposite directions, mediated by their magnetic fields.\n   - Faraday's invention of the electric motor in 1821 used a magnet and a current-carrying wire to create circular motion.\n\n4. **Electromagnetic Induction**:\n   - In 1831, Faraday's experiments demonstrated that moving a wire perpendicular to a magnetic field induces a potential difference, leading to the discovery of electromagnetic induction.\n   - Faraday's law of induction states that the induced potential difference in a closed circuit is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux through the loop.\n   - Faraday's invention of the first electrical generator in 1831 showcased the potential to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy through magnetism.\n\n5. **Electrochemistry and Electric Circuits**:\n   - Electrochemistry, starting with Volta's invention of the Voltaic pile, has evolved to include various types of batteries, electroplating, and electrolysis cells.\n   - Electric circuits involve the flow of electric charge through a closed path, fundamental for delivering electrical energy to perform tasks.\n   - Electric power, measured in watts, is the rate at which electric energy is transferred in a circuit.\n\n6. **Electricity Generation and Transmission**:\n   - Electricity generation can be achieved through electric generators, batteries, or various energy sources, typically supplied by the electric power industry.\n   - The invention of the transformer in the late 19th century enabled more efficient long-distance power transmission.\n   - Since large-scale electrical energy storage is challenging, utilities must precisely match production with demand, maintaining reserve capacity to stabilize the grid.\n\n7. **Applications of Electricity**:\n   - Electricity is a versatile and convenient energy source with applications in lighting, heating, refrigeration, air conditioning, telecommunications, and motive power.\n   - Electric motors provide efficient and clean motive power, used in various applications from stationary winches to electric vehicles.\n   - Telecommunications, starting with the electrical telegraph in 1837, have relied on electricity for global communication, a role it continues to play alongside optical fibre and satellite systems.",

                "Goodwin retired on June 1, 1957, after 40 years of active service and was advanced to the rank of Vice admiral on the retired list for having been specially commended in combat. A week later, he was invited back to his Monroe High School (now Neville High School) and handed a diploma showing that he had been graduated with the class of 1918. He then settled in Monterey, California where he taught American history at Stevenson school and was a member of the Naval Order of the United States.\n\nVice admiral Hugh H. Goodwin died at his home on February 25, 1980, aged 79. He was survived by his wife, Eleanor with whom he had two children, a daughter Sidney and a son Hugh Jr., who graduated from the Naval Academy in June 1948, but died one year later, when the Hellcat fighter he was piloting collided with another over the Gulf of Mexico during training.\n\nDecorations\n\nHere is the ribbon bar of Vice admiral Hugh H.

                "Due to the Revolts of the admirals, Blandy was forced to retire in February 1950 and Goodwin was ordered to Newport, Rhode Island for temporary duty as Chief of Staff and Aide to the President of the Naval War College under Vice admiral Donald B. Beary in April 1950. Goodwin was detached from that assignment two months and appointed member of the General Board of the Navy. He was shortly thereafter appointed acting Navy Chief of Public Information, as the substitute for Rear Admiral Russell S. Berkey, who was relieved of illness, but returned to the General Board of the Navy in July that year. Goodwin served in that capacity until February 1951, when he relieved his Academy class, Rear admiral John P. Whitney as Vice Commander, Military Air Transport Service (MATS).\n\nWhile in this capacity, Goodwin served under Lieutenant general Laurence S. Kuter and was co-responsible for the logistical support of United Nations troops fighting in Korea. The MATS operated from the United States to Japan and Goodwin served in this capacity until August 1953, when he was appointed Commander Carrier Division Two. While in this assignment, he took part in the Operation Mariner, Joint Anglo-American exercise which encountered very heavy seas over a two-week period in fall 1953.\n\nGoodwin was ordered to the Philippines in May 1954 and assumed duty as Commander, U.S. Naval Forces in the Philippines with headquarters at Naval Station Sangley Point near Cavite. He held that command in the period of tensions between Taiwan and China and publicly declared shortly after his arrival, that any attack on Taiwan by the Chinese Communists on the mainland would result in US participation in the conflict. The naval fighter planes under his command also provided escort for passing commercial planes. Goodwin worked together with retired Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, then-Ambassador to the Philippines, and accompanied him during the visits to Singapore, Bangkok and Saigon in January 1955.\n\nOn December 18, 1955, Goodwin's classmate Rear admiral Albert K. Morehouse, then serving as Commander, Naval Air Forces, Continental Air Defense Command (CONAD), died of heart attack and Goodwin was ordered to CONAD headquarters in Colorado Springs, Colorado to assume Morehouse's position. While in this capacity, he was subordinated to Army General Earle E. Partridge and was responsible for the Naval and Marine Forces allocated to the command designated for the defense of the Continental United States.\n\nRetirement",

Cook, was appointed Commander Aircraft, Scouting Force in June 1939, he requested Goodwin as his Aide and Flag Secretary. He became Admiral Cook's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and after year and half of service in the Pacific, he continued as his Aide and Flag Secretary, when Cook was appointed Commander Aircraft, Atlantic Fleet in November 1940.\n\nWorld War II\n\nFollowing the United States' entry into World War II, Goodwin was promoted to the temporary rank of Commander on January 1, 1942, and assumed duty as advisor to the Argentine Navy. His promotion was made permanent two months later and he returned to the United States in early 1943 for duty as assistant director of Planning in the Bureau of Aeronautics under Rear admiral John S. McCain. While still in Argentina, Goodwin was promoted to the temporary rank of Captain on June 21, 1942.\n\nBy the end of December 1943, Goodwin was ordered to Astoria, Oregon, where he assumed command of newly commissioned escort carrier USS Gambier Bay. He was responsible for the initial training of the crew and was known as a strict disciplinarian, but the crew appreciated the skills he taught them that prepared them for combat. Goodwin insisted that everyone aboard has to do every job right every time and made us fight our ship at her best.\n\nDuring the first half of 1944, Gambier Bay was tasked with ferrying aircraft for repairs and qualified carrier pilots from San Diego to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, before departed on May 1, 1944, to join Rear admiral Harold B. Sallada's Carrier Support Group 2, staging in the Marshalls for the invasion of the Marianas.",
                "Hugh Hilton Goodwin (December 21, 1900 \u2013 February 25, 1980) was a decorated officer in the United States Navy with the rank of Vice Admiral. A veteran of both World Wars, he commanded escort carrier  during the Mariana Islands campaign. Goodwin then served consecutively as Chief of Staff, Carrier Strike Group 6 and as Air Officer, Philippine Sea Frontier and participated in the Philippines campaign in the later part of the War.\n\nFollowing the War, he remained in the Navy and rose to the flag rank and held several important commands including Vice Commander, Military Air Transport Service, Commander, Carrier Division Two and Commander, Naval Air Forces, Continental Air Defense Command.\n\nEarly life and career\n\nHugh H. Goodwin was born on December 21, 1900, in Monroe, Louisiana and attended Monroe High School there (now Neville High School). Following the United States' entry into World War I in April 1917, Goodwin left the school without receiving the diploma in order to see some combat and enlisted the United States Navy on May 7, 1917. He completed basic training and was assigned to the battleship . Goodwin participated in the training of armed guard crews and engine room personnel as the Atlantic Fleet prepared to go to war and in November 1917, he sailed with the rest of Battleship Division 9, bound for Britain to reinforce the Grand Fleet in the North Sea.\n\nAlthough he did not complete the last year of high school, Goodwin was able to earn an appointment to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland in June 1918. While at the academy, he earned a nickname \"Huge\" and among his classmates were several future admirals and generals including: Hyman G. Rickover, Milton E. Miles, Robert E. Blick Jr., Herbert S. Duckworth, Clayton C. Jerome, James P. Riseley, James A. Stuart, Frank Peak Akers, Sherman Clark, Raymond P. Coffman, Delbert S. Cornwell, Frederick J. Eckhoff, Ralph B. DeWitt, John Higgins, Vernon Huber, Albert K. Morehouse, Harold F. Pullen, Michael J. Malanaphy, William S. Parsons, Harold R. Stevens, John P. Whitney, Lyman G. Miller and George J. O'Shea.",
                "The air unit, VC-10 Squadron, under Goodwin's command gave close air support to the initial landings of Marines on Saipan on June 15, 1944, destroying enemy gun emplacements, troops, tanks, and trucks. On the 17th, her combat air patrol (CAP) shot down or turned back all but a handful of 47 enemy planes headed for her task group and her gunners shot down two of the three planes that did break through to attack her.\n\nGoodwin's carrier continued in providing of close ground support operations at Tinian during the end of July 1944, then turned her attention to Guam, where she gave identical aid to invading troops until mid-August that year. For his service during the Mariana Islands campaign, Goodwin was decorated with Bronze Star Medal with Combat \"V\".\n\nHe was succeeded by Captain Walter V. R. Vieweg on August 18, 1944, and appointed Chief of Staff, Carrier Division Six under Rear admiral Arthur W. Radford. The Gambier Bay was sunk in the Battle off Samar on October 25, 1944, during the Battle of Leyte Gulf after helping turn back a much larger attacking Japanese surface force.\n\nGoodwin served with Carrier Division Six during the Bonin Islands raids, the naval operations at Palau and took part in the Battle of Leyte Gulf and operations supporting Leyte landings in late 1944. He was later appointed Air Officer of the Philippine Sea Frontier under Rear admiral James L. Kauffman and remained with that command until the end of hostilities. For his service in the later part of World War II, Goodwin was decorated with Legion of Merit with Combat \"V\". He was also entitled to wear two Navy Presidential Unit Citations and Navy Unit Commendation.\n\nPostwar service\n\nFollowing the surrender of Japan, Goodwin assumed command of Light aircraft carrier  on August 24, 1945. The ship was tasked with air missions over Japan became mercy flights over Allied prisoner-of-war camps, dropping food and medicine until the men could be rescued. She was also present at Tokyo Bay for the Japanese surrender on September 2, 1945.",
                "Goodwin returned with San Jacinto to the United States in mid-September 1945 and he was detached in January 1946. He subsequently served in the office of the Chief of Naval Operations until May that year, when he entered the instruction at National War College. Goodwin graduated in June 1947 and served on Secretary's committee for Research on Reorganization. Upon promotion to Rear admiral on April 1, 1949, Goodwin was appointed Chief of Staff and Aide to Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet under Admiral William H. P. Blandy.\n\nRevolt of the Admirals\n\nIn April 1949, the budget's cuts and proposed reorganization of the United States Armed Forces by the Secretary of Defense Louis A. Johnson launched the wave of discontent between senior commanders in the United States Navy. Johnson proposed the merging of the Marine Corps into the Army, and reduce the Navy to a convoy-escort force.\n\nGoodwin's superior officer, Admiral Blandy was call to testify before the House Committee on Armed Services and his harsh statements for the defense of the Navy, costed him his career. Goodwin shared his views and openly criticized Secretary Johnson for having power concentrated in a single civilian executive, who is an appointee of the Government and not an elected representative of the people. He also criticized aspects of defense unification which permitted the Joint Chiefs of Staff to vote on arms policies of individual services, and thus \"rob\" the branches of autonomy.\n\nThe outbreak of the Korean War in summer 1950 proved the proposal of Secretary Johnson as incorrect and he resigned in September that year. Also Secretary of the Navy, Francis P. Matthews resigned one month earlier.\n\nLater service",
                "Goodwin graduated with Bachelor of Science degree on June 3, 1922, and was commissioned Ensign in the United States Navy. He was subsequently assigned to the battleship  and took part in the voyage to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, before he was ordered to the Naval Torpedo Station at Newport, Rhode Island for submarine instruction in June 1923. Goodwin completed the training several weeks later and was attached to the submarine . He then continued his further training aboard submarine  and following his promotion to Lieutenant (junior grade) on June 3, 1925, he qualified as submariner.\n\nHe then served aboard submarine  off the coast of California, before he was ordered for the recruiting duty to San Francisco in September 1927. While in this capacity, Goodwin applied for naval aviation training which was ultimately approved and he was ordered to the Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida in August 1928. Toward the end of the training, he was promoted to lieutenant on December 11, 1928, and upon the completion of the training in January 1929, he was designated Naval aviator.\n\nGoodwin was subsequently attached to the Observation Squadron aboard the aircraft carrier  and participated in the Fleet exercises in the Caribbean. He was transferred to the Bureau of Aeronautics in Washington, D.C. in August 1931 and served consecutively under the architect of naval aviation William A. Moffett and future Chief of Naval Operations Ernest J. King.\n\nIn June 1933, Goodwin was ordered to the Naval War College at Newport, Rhode Island, where he completed junior course in May of the following year. He subsequently joined the crew of aircraft carrier  and served under Captain Arthur B. Cook and took part in the Fleet exercises in the Caribbean and off the East Coast of the United States.\n\nHe was ordered back to the Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida in June 1936 and was attached to the staff of the Base Commandant, then-Captain Charles A. Blakely. When Blakely was succeeded by William F. Halsey in June 1937, Goodwin remained in Halsey's staff and was promoted to Lieutenant Commander on December 1, 1937. He also completed correspondence course in International law at the Naval War College."

Another at-risk group for deficiency were those subject to decreased production of K2 by normal intestinal microbiota, as seen in broad spectrum antibiotic use.[38] Taking broad-spectrum antibiotics can reduce vitamin K production in the gut by nearly 74% in people compared with those not taking these antibiotics.[39] Diets low in vitamin K also decrease the body's vitamin K concentration.[40] Those with chronic kidney disease are at risk for vitamin K deficiency, as well as vitamin D deficiency, and particularly those with the apoE4 genotype.[41] Additionally, in the elderly there is a reduction in vitamin K2 production.[42]",

                "Adequate intake of vitamin K is associated with the inhibition of arterial calcification and stiffening,[6] but there have been few interventional studies and no good evidence that vitamin K supplementation is of any benefit in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.[7]\nOne 10-year population study, the Rotterdam Study, did show a clear and significant inverse relationship between the highest intake levels of menaquinone (mainly MK-4 from eggs and meat, and MK-8 and MK-9 from cheese) and cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in older men and women.[8]\nVitamin K has been promoted in supplement form with claims it can slow tumor growth; there is however no good medical evidence that supports such claims.[9]\nCoumarin poisoning[edit]\nVitamin K is part of the suggested treatment regime for poisoning by rodenticide (coumarin poisoning).[10]\nAlthough allergic reaction from supplementation is possible, no known toxicity is associated with high doses of the phylloquinone (vitamin K1) or menaquinone (vitamin K2) forms of vitamin K, so no tolerable upper intake level (UL) has been set.[11]\nBlood clotting (coagulation) studies in humans using 45 mg per day of vitamin K2 (as MK-4)[12] and even up to 135 mg per day (45 mg three times daily) of K2 (as MK-4),[13] showed no increase in blood clot risk. Even doses in rats as high as 250 mg/kg, body weight did not alter the tendency for blood-clot formation to occur.[14]\nUnlike the safe natural forms of vitamin K1 and vitamin K2 and their various isomers, a synthetic form of vitamin K, vitamin K3 (menadione), is demonstrably toxic at high levels. The U.S. FDA has banned this form from over-the-counter sale in the United States because large doses have been shown to cause allergic reactions, hemolytic anemia, and cytotoxicity in liver cells.[2]",

                "Warfarin and other 4-hydroxycoumarins block the action of VKOR.[60] This results in decreased concentrations of vitamin K and vitamin K hydroquinone in tissues, such that the carboxylation reaction catalyzed by the glutamyl carboxylase is inefficient. This results in the production of clotting factors with inadequate Gla. Without Gla on the amino termini of these factors, they no longer bind stably to the blood vessel endothelium and cannot activate clotting to allow formation of a clot during tissue injury. As it is impossible to predict what dose of warfarin will give the desired degree of clotting suppression, warfarin treatment must be carefully monitored to avoid overdose.\nGamma-carboxyglutamate proteins[edit]\nMain article: Gla domain\nThe following human Gla-containing proteins (\"Gla proteins\") have been characterized to the level of primary structure: blood coagulation factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, and X, anticoagulant proteins C and S, and the factor X-targeting protein Z. The bone Gla protein osteocalcin, the calcification-inhibiting matrix Gla protein (MGP), the cell growth regulating growth arrest specific gene 6 protein (Gas6), and the four transmembrane Gla proteins (TMGPs), the function of which is at present unknown. Gas6 can function as a growth factor to activate the Axl receptor tyrosine kinase and stimulate cell proliferation or prevent apoptosis in some cells. In all cases in which their function was known, the presence of the Gla residues in these proteins turned out to be essential for functional activity.\nGla proteins are known to occur in a wide variety of vertebrates: mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish. The venom of a number of Australian snakes acts by activating the human blood-clotting system. In some cases, activation is accomplished by snake Gla-containing enzymes that bind to the endothelium of human blood vessels and catalyze the conversion of procoagulant clotting factors into activated ones, leading to unwanted and potentially deadly clotting.",
                "The precise function of vitamin K was not discovered until 1974, when three laboratories (Stenflo et al.,[87] Nelsestuen et al.,[88] and Magnusson et al.[89]) isolated the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor prothrombin (factor II) from cows that received a high dose of a vitamin K antagonist, warfarin. It was shown that, while warfarin-treated cows had a form of prothrombin that contained 10 glutamate (Glu) amino acid residues near the amino terminus of this protein, the normal (untreated) cows contained 10 unusual residues that were chemically identified as \u03b3-carboxyglutamate (Gla). The extra carboxyl group in Gla made clear that vitamin K plays a role in a carboxylation reaction during which Glu is converted into Gla.\nThe biochemistry of how vitamin K is used to convert Glu to Gla has been elucidated over the past thirty years in academic laboratories throughout the world.",

MK-4 and MK-7 are both subtypes of K2.\nVitamin K deficiency, Warfarin overdose\nVitamin K is a group of structurally similar, fat-soluble vitamins the human body requires for complete synthesis of certain proteins that are prerequisites for blood coagulation and which the body also needs for controlling binding of calcium in bones and other tissues. The vitamin K-related modification of the proteins allows them to bind calcium ions, which they cannot do otherwise. Without vitamin K, blood coagulation is seriously impaired, and uncontrolled bleeding occurs. Low levels of vitamin K also weaken bones and promote calcification of arteries and other soft tissues[citation needed].\nChemically, the vitamin K family comprises 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (3-) derivatives. Vitamin K includes two natural vitamers: vitamin K1 and vitamin K2.[1] Vitamin K2, in turn, consists of a number of related chemical subtypes, with differing lengths of carbon side chains made of isoprenoid groups of atoms.\nVitamin K1, also known as phylloquinone, is made by plants, and is found in highest amounts in green leafy vegetables because it is directly involved in photosynthesis. It may be thought of as the plant form of vitamin K. It is active as a vitamin in animals and performs the classic functions of vitamin K, including its activity in the production of blood-clotting proteins. Animals may also convert it to vitamin K2.",

                "Many bacteria, such as Escherichia coli found in the large intestine, can synthesize vitamin K2 (menaquinone-7 or MK-7, up to MK-11),[70] but not vitamin K1 (phylloquinone). In these bacteria, menaquinone transfers two electrons between two different small molecules, during oxygen-independent metabolic energy production processes (anaerobic respiration).[71] For example, a small molecule with an excess of electrons (also called an electron donor) such as lactate, formate, or NADH, with the help of an enzyme, passes two electrons to menaquinone. The menaquinone, with the help of another enzyme, then transfers these two electrons to a suitable oxidant, such fumarate or nitrate (also called an electron acceptor). Adding two electrons to fumarate or nitrate converts the molecule to succinate or nitrite plus water, respectively.\nSome of these reactions generate a cellular energy source, ATP, in a manner similar to eukaryotic cell aerobic respiration, except the final electron acceptor is not molecular oxygen, but fumarate or nitrate. In aerobic respiration, the final oxidant is molecular oxygen (O2), which accepts four electrons from an electron donor such as NADH to be converted to water. E. coli, as facultative anaerobes, can carry out both aerobic respiration and menaquinone-mediated anaerobic respiration.\nInjection in newborns[edit]\nThe blood clotting factors of newborn babies are roughly 30\u201360% that of adult values; this may be due to the reduced synthesis of precursor proteins and the sterility of their guts. Human milk contains 1\u20134 \u03bcg/L of vitamin K1, while formula-derived milk can contain up to 100 \u03bcg/L in supplemented formulas. Vitamin K2 concentrations in human milk appear to be much lower than those of vitamin K1. Occurrence of vitamin K deficiency bleeding in the first week of the infant's life is estimated at 0.25\u20131.7%, with a prevalence of 2\u201310 cases per 100,000 births.[72] Premature babies have even lower levels of the vitamin, so they are at a higher risk from this deficiency.",

                "Bleeding in infants due to vitamin K deficiency can be severe, leading to hospitalization, blood transfusions, brain damage, and death. Supplementation can prevent most cases of vitamin K deficiency bleeding in the newborn. Intramuscular administration is more effective in preventing late vitamin K deficiency bleeding than oral administration.[73][74]\nAs a result of the occurrences of vitamin K deficiency bleeding, the Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended 0.5\u20131 mg of vitamin K1 be administered to all newborns shortly after birth.[74]\nIn the UK vitamin K supplementation is recommended for all newborns within the first 24 hours.[75] This is usually given as a single intramuscular injection of 1 mg shortly after birth but as a second-line option can be given by three oral doses over the first month.[76]\nControversy arose in the early 1990s regarding this practice, when two studies suggested a relationship between parenteral administration of vitamin K and childhood cancer,[77] however, poor methods and small sample sizes led to the discrediting of these studies, and a review of the evidence published in 2000 by Ross and Davies found no link between the two.[78] Doctors reported emerging concerns in 2013,[79] after treating children for serious bleeding problems. They cited lack-of newborn vitamin K administration, as the reason that the problems occurred, and recommended that breastfed babies could have an increased risk unless they receive a preventative dose.",
                "In the early 1930s, Danish scientist Henrik Dam investigated the role of cholesterol by feeding chickens a cholesterol-depleted diet.[80] He initially replicated experiments reported by scientists at the Ontario Agricultural College (OAC).[81] McFarlane, Graham and Richardson, working on the chick feed program at OAC, had used chloroform to remove all fat from chick chow. They noticed that chicks fed only fat-depleted chow developed hemorrhages and started bleeding from tag sites.[82] Dam found that these defects could not be restored by adding purified cholesterol to the diet. It appeared that \u2013 together with the cholesterol \u2013 a second compound had been extracted from the food, and this compound was called the coagulation vitamin. The new vitamin received the letter K because the initial discoveries were reported in a German journal, in which it was designated as Koagulationsvitamin. Edward Adelbert Doisy of Saint Louis University did much of the research that led to the discovery of the structure and chemical nature of vitamin K.[83] Dam and Doisy shared the 1943 Nobel Prize for medicine for their work on vitamin K (K1 and K2) published in 1939. Several laboratories synthesized the compound(s) in 1939.[84]\nFor several decades, the vitamin K-deficient chick model was the only method of quantifying vitamin K in various foods: the chicks were made vitamin K-deficient and subsequently fed with known amounts of vitamin K-containing food. The extent to which blood coagulation was restored by the diet was taken as a measure for its vitamin K content. Three groups of physicians independently found this: Biochemical Institute, University of Copenhagen (Dam and Johannes Glavind), University of Iowa Department of Pathology (Emory Warner, Kenneth Brinkhous, and Harry Pratt Smith), and the Mayo Clinic (Hugh Butt, Albert Snell, and Arnold Osterberg).[85]\nThe first published report of successful treatment with vitamin K of life-threatening hemorrhage in a jaundiced patient with prothrombin deficiency was made in 1938 by Smith, Warner, and Brinkhous.[86]",
                "Phylloquinone (K1)[15][16] or menaquinone (K2) are capable of reversing the anticoagulant activity of the anticoagulant warfarin (tradename Coumadin). Warfarin works by blocking recycling of vitamin K, so that the body and tissues have lower levels of active vitamin K, and thus a deficiency of vitamin K.\nSupplemental vitamin K (for which oral dosing is often more active than injectable dosing in human adults) reverses the vitamin K deficiency caused by warfarin, and therefore reduces the intended anticoagulant action of warfarin and related drugs.[17] Sometimes small amounts of vitamin K are given orally to patients taking warfarin so that the action of the drug is more predictable.[17] The proper anticoagulant action of the drug is a function of vitamin K intake and drug dose, and due to differing absorption must be individualized for each patient.[citation needed] The action of warfarin and vitamin K both require two to five days after dosing to have maximum effect, and neither warfarin or vitamin K shows much effect in the first 24 hours after they are given.[18]\nThe newer anticoagulants dabigatran and rivaroxaban have different mechanisms of action that do not interact with vitamin K, and may be taken with supplemental vitamin K.[19][20]\nVitamin K2 (menaquinone). In menaquinone, the side chain is composed of a varying number of isoprenoid residues. The most common number of these residues is four, since animal enzymes normally produce menaquinone-4 from plant phylloquinone.\nA sample of phytomenadione for injection, also called phylloquinone\nThe three synthetic forms of vitamin K are vitamins K3 (menadione), K4, and K5, which are used in many areas, including the pet food industry (vitamin K3) and to inhibit fungal growth (vitamin K5).[21]\nConversion of vitamin K1 to vitamin K2[edit]\nVitamin K1 (phylloquinone) \u2013 both forms of the vitamin contain a functional naphthoquinone ring and an aliphatic side chain.

                "The National Academy of Medicine (NAM) updated an estimate of what constitutes an adequate intake (AI) for vitamin K in 2001. The NAM does not distinguish between K1 and K2 \u2013 both are counted as vitamin K. At that time there was not sufficient evidence to set the more rigorous estimated average requirement (EAR) or recommended dietary allowance (RDA) given for most of the essential vitamins and minerals. The current daily AIs for vitamin K for adult women and men are 90 \u03bcg and 120 \u03bcg respectively. The AI for pregnancy and lactation is 90 \u03bcg. For infants up to 12 months the AI is 2\u20132.5 \u03bcg, and for children aged 1 to 18 years the AI increases with age from 30 to 75 \u03bcg. As for safety, the FNB also sets tolerable upper intake levels (known as ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of vitamin K no UL is set, as evidence for adverse effects is not sufficient. Collectively EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as dietary reference intakes.[43] The European Food Safety Authority reviewed the same safety question and did not set an UL.[44]\nFor U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percentage of daily value (%DV). For vitamin K labeling purposes the daily value was 80 \u03bcg, but as of May 2016 it has been revised upwards to 120 \u03bcg. A table of the pre-change adult daily values is provided at reference daily intake.

                "Bacteria in the gut flora can also convert K1 into vitamin K2. In addition, bacteria typically lengthen the isoprenoid side chain of vitamin K2 to produce a range of vitamin K2 forms, most notably the MK-7 to MK-11 homologues of vitamin K2. All forms of K2 other than MK-4 can only be produced by bacteria, which use these forms in anaerobic respiration. The MK-7 and other bacterially derived forms of vitamin K2 exhibit vitamin K activity in animals, but MK-7's extra utility over MK-4, if any, is unclear and is a matter of investigation.\nThree synthetic types of vitamin K are known: vitamins K3, K4, and K5. Although the natural K1 and all K2 homologues and synthetic K4 and K5 have proven nontoxic, the synthetic form K3 (menadione) has shown toxicity.[2]\n1.2 Cardiovascular health\n1.4 Coumarin poisoning\n4.1 Conversion of vitamin K1 to vitamin K2\n4.2 Vitamin K2\n6 Absorption and dietary need\n7 Dietary reference intake\n10 Biochemistry\n10.1 Function in animals\n10.2 Gamma-carboxyglutamate proteins\n10.3 Methods of assessment\n10.4 Function in bacteria\n11 Injection in newborns\n11.3 Controversy\nA review of 2014 concluded that there is positive evidence that monotherapy using MK-4, one of the forms of Vitamin K2, reduces fracture incidence in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis, and suggested further research on the combined use of MK-4 with bisphosphonates. In contrast, an earlier review article of 2013 concluded that there is no good evidence that vitamin K supplementation helps prevent osteoporosis or fractures in postmenopausal women.[3]\nA Cochrane systematic review of 2006 suggested that supplementation with Vitamin K1 and with MK4 reduces bone loss; in particular, a strong effect of MK-4 on incident fractures among Japanese patients was emphasized.[4]\nA review article of 2016 suggested to consider, as one of several measures for bone health, increasing the intake of foods rich in vitamins K1 and K2.[5]\nCardiovascular health[edit]",
                "Osteoporosis[51][52] and coronary heart disease[53][54] are strongly associated with lower levels of K2 (menaquinone). Vitamin K2 (as menaquinones MK-4 through MK-10) intake level is inversely related to severe aortic calcification and all-cause mortality.[8]\nFunction in animals[edit]\nMechanism of action of vitamin K1.\nThe function of vitamin K2 in the animal cell is to add a carboxylic acid functional group to a glutamate (Glu) amino acid residue in a protein, to form a gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residue. This is a somewhat uncommon posttranslational modification of the protein, which is then known as a \"Gla protein\". The presence of two \u2212COOH (carboxylic acid) groups on the same carbon in the gamma-carboxyglutamate residue allows it to chelate calcium ions. The binding of calcium ions in this way very often triggers the function or binding of Gla-protein enzymes, such as the so-called vitamin K-dependent clotting factors discussed below.\nWithin the cell, vitamin K undergoes electron reduction to a reduced form called vitamin K hydroquinone, catalyzed by the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR).[55] Another enzyme then oxidizes vitamin K hydroquinone to allow carboxylation of Glu to Gla; this enzyme is called gamma-glutamyl carboxylase[56][57] or the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase. The carboxylation reaction only proceeds if the carboxylase enzyme is able to oxidize vitamin K hydroquinone to vitamin K epoxide at the same time. The carboxylation and epoxidation reactions are said to be coupled. Vitamin K epoxide is then reconverted to vitamin K by VKOR. The reduction and subsequent reoxidation of vitamin K coupled with carboxylation of Glu is called the vitamin K cycle.[58] Humans are rarely deficient in vitamin K1 because, in part, vitamin K1 is continuously recycled in cells.[59]",
                "Vitamin K1 is found chiefly in leafy green vegetables such as dandelion greens (which contain 778.4 \u03bcg per 100 g, or 741% of the recommended daily amount), spinach, swiss chard, lettuce and Brassica vegetables (such as cabbage, kale, cauliflower, broccoli, and brussels sprouts) and often the absorption is greater when accompanied by fats such as butter or oils; some fruits, such as avocados, kiwifruit and grapes, are also high in vitamin K. By way of reference, two tablespoons of parsley contains 153% of the recommended daily amount of vitamin K.[47] Some vegetable oils, notably soybean oil, contain vitamin K, but at levels that would require relatively large calorie consumption to meet the USDA-recommended levels.[48] colonic bacteria synthesize a significant portion of humans' vitamin K needs; newborns often receive a vitamin K shot at birth to tide them over until their colons become colonized at five to seven days of age from the consumption of breast milk.\nThe tight binding of vitamin K1 to thylakoid membranes in chloroplasts makes it less bioavailable. For example, cooked spinach has a 5% bioavailability of phylloquinone, however, fat added to it increases bioavailability to 13% due to the increased solubility of vitamin K in fat.[49]\nMain article: Vitamin K deficiency\nAverage diets are usually not lacking in vitamin K, and primary deficiency is rare in healthy adults. Newborn infants are at an increased risk of deficiency. Other populations with an increased prevalence of vitamin K deficiency include those who suffer from liver damage or disease (e.g. alcoholics), cystic fibrosis, or inflammatory bowel diseases, or have recently had abdominal surgeries. Secondary vitamin K deficiency can occur in people with bulimia, those on stringent diets, and those taking anticoagulants. Other drugs associated with vitamin K deficiency include salicylates, barbiturates, and cefamandole, although the mechanisms are still unknown. Vitamin K1 deficiency can result in coagulopathy, a bleeding disorder.[50]Symptoms of K1 deficiency include anemia, bruising, nosebleeds and bleeding of the gums in both sexes, and heavy menstrual bleeding in women.",

                "Another interesting class of invertebrate Gla-containing proteins is synthesized by the fish-hunting snail Conus geographus.[61] These snails produce a venom containing hundreds of neuroactive peptides, or conotoxins, which is sufficiently toxic to kill an adult human. Several of the conotoxins contain two to five Gla residues.[62]\nMethods of assessment[edit]\nVitamin K status can be assessed by:\nThe prothrombin time (PT) test measures the time required for blood to clot. A blood sample is mixed with citric acid and put in a fibrometer; delayed clot formation indicates a deficiency. This test is insensitive to mild deficiency, as the values do not change until the concentration of prothrombin in the blood has declined by at least 50%.[63]\nUndercarboxylated prothrombin (PIVKA-II); in a study of 53 newborns, found \"PT (prothrombin time) is a less sensitive marker than PIVKA II\",[64] and as indicated above, PT is unable to detect subclinical deficiencies that can be detected with PIVKA-II testing.\nPlasma phylloquinone was found to be positively correlated with phylloquinone intake in elderly British women, but not men,[65] but an article by Schurgers et al. reported no correlation between FFQ[further explanation needed] and plasma phylloquinone.[66]\nUrinary \u03b3-carboxyglutamic acid responds to changes in dietary vitamin K intake. Several days are required before any change can be observed. In a study by Booth et al., increases of phylloquinone intakes from 100 \u03bcg to between 377 and 417 \u03bcg for five days did not induce a significant change. Response may be age-specific.[67]\nUndercarboxylated osteocalcin (UcOc) levels have been inversely correlated with stores of vitamin K[68] and bone strength in developing rat tibiae. Another study following 78 post-menopausal Korean women found a supplement regimen of vitamins K and D, and calcium, but not a regimen of vitamin D and calcium, was inversely correlated with reduced UcOc levels.[69]\nFunction in bacteria[edit]",

                "The MK-4 form of vitamin K2 is produced by conversion of vitamin K1 in the testes, pancreas, and arterial walls.[22] While major questions still surround the biochemical pathway for this transformation, the conversion is not dependent on gut bacteria, as it occurs in germ-free rats[23][24] and in parenterally-administered K1 in rats.[25][26] In fact, tissues that accumulate high amounts of MK-4 have a remarkable capacity to convert up to 90% of the available K1 into MK-4.[27][28] There is evidence that the conversion proceeds by removal of the phytyl tail of K1 to produce menadione as an intermediate, which is then condensed with an activated geranylgeranyl moiety (see also prenylation) to produce vitamin K2 in the MK-4 (menatetrione) form.[29]\nVitamin K2[edit]\nMain article: Vitamin K2\nVitamin K2 (menaquinone) includes several subtypes. The two subtypes most studied are menaquinone-4 (menatetrenone, MK-4) and menaquinone-7 (MK-7).\nVitamin K1, the precursor of most vitamin K in nature, is a stereoisomer of phylloquinone, an important chemical in green plants, where it functions as an electron acceptor in photosystem I during photosynthesis. For this reason, vitamin K1 is found in large quantities in the photosynthetic tissues of plants (green leaves, and dark green leafy vegetables such as romaine lettuce, kale and spinach), but it occurs in far smaller quantities in other plant tissues (roots, fruits, etc.). Iceberg lettuce contains relatively little. The function of phylloquinone in plants appears to have no resemblance to its later metabolic and biochemical function (as \"vitamin K\") in animals, where it performs a completely different biochemical reaction.\nVitamin K (in animals) is involved in the carboxylation of certain glutamate residues in proteins to form gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues. The modified residues are often (but not always) situated within specific protein domains called Gla domains. Gla residues are usually involved in binding calcium, and are essential for the biological activity of all known Gla proteins.[30]",

                "17 human proteins with Gla domains have been identified, playing roles in blood coagulation, bone metabolism, and vascular biology. Vitamin K is essential for the function of these proteins and is stored in fatty tissue. Dietary deficiency of vitamin K is rare unless the small intestine is damaged or broad-spectrum antibiotics are used, which can reduce gut production of vitamin K by 74%. Chronic kidney disease and the elderly are also at risk for vitamin K deficiency.",

The article references several studies that explore the role of vitamin K in various biological processes and its distribution in rat tissues.",
                "Vitamin K is essential for blood clotting and bone health, with two main forms: K1 (phylloquinone) from plants and K2 (menaquinones) from bacteria. It plays a crucial role in bone metabolism and cardiovascular health by activating proteins that regulate calcium. Studies suggest that adequate Vitamin K intake can reduce fracture risk and improve bone density. Additionally, Vitamin K2 may promote cardiovascular health by preventing calcium buildup in arteries. However, evidence for Vitamin K's primary prevention of cardiovascular disease is inconclusive.",

For infants, children, and pregnant or lactating women, AIs vary based on age and condition. No tolerable upper intake level (UL) is set for vitamin K due to insufficient evidence of adverse effects. The European Food Safety Authority also did not set a UL. For U.S. labeling purposes, the daily value for vitamin K was increased from 80 \u03bcg to 120 \u03bcg in May 2016, with compliance required by July 2018.",

These bacterially derived forms of vitamin K2 are used in anaerobic respiration and exhibit vitamin K activity in animals. Synthetic forms of vitamin K include K3, K4, and K5, with K3 being toxic. Vitamin K2, particularly MK-4, has shown potential in reducing fracture incidence in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis, though further research is needed. Supplementation with vitamin K1 and MK-4 has been suggested to reduce bone loss, and increasing intake of foods rich in vitamins K1 and K2 is recommended for bone health.",
                "Osteoporosis and coronary heart disease are linked to lower levels of Vitamin K2 (menaquinone), which is inversely related to severe aortic calcification and all-cause mortality. Vitamin K2 functions in animals by adding a carboxylic acid group to glutamate residues in proteins, forming gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues that can chelate calcium ions, often triggering the function of Gla-protein enzymes. Within cells, Vitamin K undergoes reduction and reoxidation in a cycle catalyzed by specific enzymes, enabling the carboxylation of glutamate to Gla. This process is crucial for the function of many proteins, including those involved in blood clotting. Human deficiency in Vitamin K1 is rare due to its continuous recycling within cells.",
                "Vitamin K1 is primarily found in leafy green vegetables like dandelion greens, spinach, and Brassica vegetables, and its absorption is enhanced by fats. It is also present in some fruits and vegetable oils, though in lower concentrations. Colonic bacteria synthesize a significant portion of human vitamin K needs, and newborns often receive a vitamin K shot at birth. The bioavailability of vitamin K1 is lower when tightly bound to thylakoid membranes in chloroplasts, but it increases with the addition of fats. Vitamin K deficiency is rare in healthy adults but can occur in newborns, those with liver disease, cystic fibrosis, or inflammatory bowel diseases, and individuals on anticoagulants or strict diets. Deficiency symptoms include coagulopathy, anemia, bruising, and bleeding disorders.",
                "Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin essential for blood coagulation and bone health. It was discovered by Danish scientist Henrik Dam, who received the Nobel Prize for his work in 1943. Vitamin K is crucial for the synthesis of proteins involved in blood clotting, such as prothrombin, which require the post-translational modification of glutamic acid residues to \u03b3-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) to function properly. This modification is facilitated by vitamin K. Therapeutically, vitamin K is used to treat bleeding disorders caused by vitamin K deficiency, such as those seen in obstructive jaundice. The discovery and synthesis of vitamin K, particularly K1 (phylloquinone), have been pivotal in understanding its biological roles and applications in medicine.",

It highlights that foods high in Vitamin K, such as parsley and fermented soybeans (natto), can affect the efficacy of Warfarin. The text references studies showing that natto, a fermented soybean product rich in Vitamin K, is associated with reduced bone loss in postmenopausal women and increased bone mineral density in premenopausal women. Additionally, it mentions that Vitamin K2 can induce iNOS in vascular smooth muscle cells, though its relationship with nitric oxide production and gamma-carboxylation is unclear. The text emphasizes the need for patients on Warfarin to maintain a consistent intake of Vitamin K-rich foods to avoid fluctuations in blood clotting ability.",
                "The fish-hunting snail Conus geographus synthesizes a venom containing neuroactive peptides, or conotoxins, with several containing Gla residues. Vitamin K status can be assessed through prothrombin time (PT) tests, undercarboxylated prothrombin (PIVKA-II), plasma phylloquinone, urinary \u03b3-carboxyglutamic acid, and undercarboxylated osteocalcin (UcOc) levels. PT tests are less sensitive to mild deficiencies, while PIVKA-II can detect subclinical deficiencies. Plasma phylloquinone levels correlate with intake in elderly women but not men. Urinary \u03b3-carboxyglutamic acid responds to dietary vitamin K changes after several days. UcOc levels are inversely correlated with vitamin K stores and bone strength, with supplements of vitamins K and D, and calcium reducing UcOc levels in post-menopausal women.",

                        "Vitamin K is a group of fat-soluble vitamins essential for the synthesis of certain proteins required for blood coagulation and calcium binding in bones and tissues. It includes two natural vitamers: vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) produced by plants, and vitamin K2, which consists of various subtypes with different carbon side chains. Vitamin K1 is abundant in green leafy vegetables and plays a key role in photosynthesis, while both forms are crucial for blood clotting and bone health. Deficiency in vitamin K can lead to impaired blood coagulation, weakened bones, and arterial calcification.",
                        "Bacteria in the gut flora can convert vitamin K1 into vitamin K2, with bacteria producing various forms of K2, such as MK-7 to MK-11. These bacterially derived forms of vitamin K2 are used in anaerobic respiration and exhibit vitamin K activity in animals. Synthetic forms of vitamin K include K3, K4, and K5, with K3 being toxic. Vitamin K2, particularly MK-4, has shown potential in reducing fracture incidence in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis, though further research is needed. Supplementation with vitamin K1 and MK-4 has been suggested to reduce bone loss, and increasing intake of foods rich in vitamins K1 and K2 is recommended for bone health.",
                        "Vitamin K intake is linked to inhibiting arterial calcification and stiffening, but there's limited evidence supporting its use in primary cardiovascular disease prevention. A study found a significant inverse relationship between high menaquinone intake and cardiovascular disease in older adults. Vitamin K supplements are not supported by medical evidence for slowing tumor growth. It's used in treating coumarin poisoning and has no known toxicity at high doses of its natural forms (K1 and K2), unlike the synthetic K3, which is banned in the U.S. due to toxicity.",
                        "Phylloquinone (K1) and menaquinone (K2) can reverse the anticoagulant effects of warfarin by replenishing vitamin K levels, which warfarin depletes. Oral vitamin K supplementation is more effective than injectable forms in adults and can make warfarin's action more predictable. The newer anticoagulants dabigatran and rivaroxaban do not interact with vitamin K. Vitamin K2, a form of vitamin K, has a side chain of varying isoprenoid residues, with menaquinone-4 being the most common. Synthetic forms of vitamin K, such as K3, K4, and K5, are used in various industries, including pet food and antifungal applications.",
                        "The MK-4 form of vitamin K2 is produced through the conversion of vitamin K1 in the testes, pancreas, and arterial walls. This conversion does not rely on gut bacteria and can occur in germ-free rats and through parenteral administration of K1. Tissues that accumulate high amounts of MK-4 can convert up to 90% of available K1 into MK-4. The conversion process involves the removal of the phytyl tail of K1 to produce menadione, which then combines with an activated geranylgeranyl moiety to form MK-4. Vitamin K2 includes subtypes such as MK-4 and MK-7, with vitamin K1 being a precursor found in green plants, particularly in photosynthetic tissues like green leaves and dark green leafy vegetables. Vitamin K1 functions as an electron acceptor in photosynthesis and has no direct relation to its role as a vitamin in animals, where it is involved in the carboxylation of glutamate residues to form gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues, essential for the activity of Gla proteins.",
                        "17 human proteins with Gla domains have been identified, playing roles in blood coagulation, bone metabolism, and vascular biology. Vitamin K is essential for the function of these proteins and is stored in fatty tissue. Dietary deficiency of vitamin K is rare unless the small intestine is damaged or broad-spectrum antibiotics are used, which can reduce gut production of vitamin K by 74%. Chronic kidney disease and the elderly are also at risk for vitamin K deficiency.",
                        "The National Academy of Medicine (NAM) updated the adequate intake (AI) for vitamin K in 2001, setting AIs for adult women and men at 90 \u03bcg and 120 \u03bcg respectively, with no distinction between K1 and K2. For infants, children, and pregnant or lactating women, AIs vary based on age and condition. No tolerable upper intake level (UL) is set for vitamin K due to insufficient evidence of adverse effects. The European Food Safety Authority also did not set a UL. For U.S. labeling purposes, the daily value for vitamin K was increased from 80 \u03bcg to 120 \u03bcg in May 2016, with compliance required by July 2018.",
                        "Vitamin K1 is primarily found in leafy green vegetables like dandelion greens, spinach, and Brassica vegetables, and its absorption is enhanced by fats. It is also present in some fruits and vegetable oils, though in lower concentrations. Colonic bacteria synthesize a significant portion of human vitamin K needs, and newborns often receive a vitamin K shot at birth. The bioavailability of vitamin K1 is lower when tightly bound to thylakoid membranes in chloroplasts, but it increases with the addition of fats. Vitamin K deficiency is rare in healthy adults but can occur in newborns, those with liver disease, cystic fibrosis, or inflammatory bowel diseases, and individuals on anticoagulants or strict diets. Deficiency symptoms include coagulopathy, anemia, bruising, and bleeding disorders."

                        "Osteoporosis and coronary heart disease are linked to lower levels of Vitamin K2 (menaquinone), which is inversely related to severe aortic calcification and all-cause mortality. Vitamin K2 functions in animals by adding a carboxylic acid group to glutamate residues in proteins, forming gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues that can chelate calcium ions, often triggering the function of Gla-protein enzymes. Within cells, Vitamin K undergoes reduction and reoxidation in a cycle catalyzed by specific enzymes, enabling the carboxylation of glutamate to Gla. This process is crucial for the function of many proteins, including those involved in blood clotting. Human deficiency in Vitamin K1 is rare due to its continuous recycling within cells.",
                        "Warfarin and related compounds inhibit the action of VKOR, reducing vitamin K and vitamin K hydroquinone levels, which impairs the carboxylation of clotting factors and results in inadequate Gla. This prevents stable binding to blood vessel endothelium and proper clot activation. Monitoring is crucial to avoid overdose. Gla-containing proteins, including blood coagulation factors and anticoagulants, are essential for their functions. These proteins are found in various vertebrates, and some snake venoms activate human clotting through Gla-containing enzymes, potentially causing harmful clotting.",
                        "The fish-hunting snail Conus geographus synthesizes a venom containing neuroactive peptides, or conotoxins, with several containing Gla residues. Vitamin K status can be assessed through prothrombin time (PT) tests, undercarboxylated prothrombin (PIVKA-II), plasma phylloquinone, urinary \u03b3-carboxyglutamic acid, and undercarboxylated osteocalcin (UcOc) levels. PT tests are less sensitive to mild deficiencies, while PIVKA-II can detect subclinical deficiencies. Plasma phylloquinone levels correlate with intake in elderly women but not men. Urinary \u03b3-carboxyglutamic acid responds to dietary vitamin K changes after several days. UcOc levels are inversely correlated with vitamin K stores and bone strength, with supplements of vitamins K and D, and calcium reducing UcOc levels in post-menopausal women.",
                        "Bacteria like Escherichia coli in the large intestine can produce vitamin K2 (menaquinone) for anaerobic respiration, transferring electrons between donors and acceptors like fumarate or nitrate, which can generate ATP. Unlike vitamin K1 (phylloquinone), vitamin K2 is not synthesized by these bacteria. Newborns have lower blood clotting factors, partly due to reduced vitamin K synthesis and sterile guts. Human milk contains vitamin K1, while formula can have higher levels. Vitamin K2 in human milk is lower. Vitamin K deficiency bleeding occurs in 0.25\u20131.7% of infants, with higher risk for premature babies.",
                        "Vitamin K deficiency in infants can cause severe bleeding, leading to hospitalization, blood transfusions, brain damage, and death. Supplementation, particularly through intramuscular administration, effectively prevents this condition. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends 0.5\u20131 mg of vitamin K1 for all newborns shortly after birth, while the UK advises a 1 mg intramuscular injection within the first 24 hours. Controversy arose in the 1990s over a potential link between vitamin K administration and childhood cancer, but subsequent reviews found no evidence of such a connection. In 2013, doctors highlighted the importance of vitamin K administration to prevent serious bleeding in newborns, especially for breastfed babies.",
                        "In the early 1930s, Danish scientist Henrik Dam discovered vitamin K while studying cholesterol's role in chickens' diets. He found that a cholesterol-depleted diet caused bleeding in chicks, which could not be remedied by adding purified cholesterol. This led to the identification of a second compound, later named vitamin K (Koagulationsvitamin in German). Edward Adelbert Doisy later contributed to understanding its structure and chemical nature. Dam and Doisy shared the 1943 Nobel Prize for their work. Vitamin K-deficient chicks were used to measure vitamin K in foods, and in 1938, vitamin K was successfully used to treat a patient with life-threatening hemorrhage.",
                        "In 1974, research by three laboratories revealed that vitamin K's primary function is to facilitate the carboxylation of glutamate (Glu) to \u03b3-carboxyglutamate (Gla) in proteins, such as prothrombin, a key coagulation factor. This discovery was made by studying cows treated with a vitamin K antagonist, warfarin, which produced a form of prothrombin with Glu residues instead of the usual Gla residues. Over the past three decades, the biochemical process of vitamin K-dependent carboxylation has been extensively studied globally.",
                        "Vitamin K is essential for blood clotting and bone health, with two main forms: K1 (phylloquinone) from plants and K2 (menaquinones) from bacteria. It plays a crucial role in bone metabolism and cardiovascular health by activating proteins that regulate calcium. Studies suggest that adequate Vitamin K intake can reduce fracture risk and improve bone density. Additionally, Vitamin K2 may promote cardiovascular health by preventing calcium buildup in arteries. However, evidence for Vitamin K's primary prevention of cardiovascular disease is inconclusive."

The study is referenced in various sources, including the American Cancer Society's guide to complementary and alternative cancer therapies, and discussions on vitamin K's role in bone health and coagulation. Additional research supports the safety of adding vitamins and minerals to foods and the benefits of combined vitamin K2 and D3 therapy for bone mineral density in postmenopausal women.",

(2004) provided a comprehensive review on the pharmacology and management of vitamin K antagonists, highlighting their role in antithrombotic therapy. Crowther et al. (2002) conducted a trial comparing the efficacy of oral versus subcutaneous vitamin K in treating warfarin-associated coagulopathy, showing that oral vitamin K is more rapid in lowering the international normalized ratio. Additionally, guidelines from the National Institute of Health and the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists emphasize the importance of monitoring vitamin K intake when using warfarin. Finally, Bauersachs et al. (2010) discussed drug interactions, including those with Pradaxa, a direct thrombin inhibitor.",

This family includes Gla-rich protein (GRP), which is highly conserved in vertebrates and identified from sturgeon cartilage. GRP is present in serum and accumulates at sites of pathological calcifications. Additionally, Gas6 and protein S are vitamin K-dependent ligands for the Axl receptor tyrosine kinase subfamily. Proline-rich Gla protein 2 is another cell-surface vitamin K-dependent protein that binds to the transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein.",

Vitamin K is essential for blood clotting and bone health. Studies have shown that broad-spectrum antimicrobials can reduce vitamin K2 concentrations in the liver, leading to potential deficiencies. Dietary-induced subclinical vitamin K deficiency has been observed in normal human subjects. Additionally, vitamins K and D status have been examined in stages 3-5 chronic kidney disease patients. Age-related changes in circulating levels of vitamin K2 congeners have also been documented.

It includes two primary forms: vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) and vitamin K2 (menaquinone), with K1 predominantly found in green leafy vegetables and K2 produced by gut bacteria and in certain tissues. Vitamin K1 plays a key role in photosynthesis and is crucial for blood clotting and bone health, while K2, particularly MK-4 and MK-7, has shown potential benefits in reducing fracture incidence in osteoporosis and inhibiting arterial calcification.\n\nBacteria in the gut can convert vitamin K1 into various forms of vitamin K2, which are used in anaerobic respiration and exhibit vitamin K activity in animals. Synthetic forms of vitamin K, such as K3, K4, and K5, exist, but K3 is toxic and banned in the U.S. Vitamin K deficiency can lead to impaired blood coagulation, weakened bones, and arterial calcification, though it is rare unless the small intestine is damaged or broad-spectrum antibiotics are used.\n\nVitamin K intake is linked to cardiovascular health, with studies suggesting an inverse relationship between high menaquinone intake and cardiovascular disease in older adults. However, there is limited evidence supporting its use in primary cardiovascular disease prevention. Vitamin K supplements are not recommended for slowing tumor growth and are primarily used in treating coumarin poisoning.\n\nPhylloquinone (K1) and menaquinone (K2) can reverse the anticoagulant effects of warfarin by replenishing vitamin K levels, with oral supplementation being more effective than injectable forms.

                "Therefore, 5 would qualify as a Kekul\u00e9 triplet, of which only a handful of examples exist . However, definitive synthesis of 5 has never been reported so far. Previously, Dressler et al. reported transient isolation of mesityl-substituted 5, where it decomposed both in the solution and in solid state , and only the structural proof of the corresponding dianion was obtained.\nOn-surface generation of a derivative of 5, starting from truxene as a precursor, was recently reported . STM data on this compound, containing the indeno[1,2-a]fluorene moiety as part of a larger PCH, was interpreted to indicate its open-shell ground state. However, the results did not imply the ground state of unsubstituted 5. Here, we show that on insulating surfaces 5 can exhibit either of two ground states: an open-shell or a closed-shell.\nWe infer the existence of these two ground states based on high-resolution AFM imaging with bond-order discrimination and STM imaging of molecular orbital densities . AFM imaging reveals molecules with two different geometries. Characteristic bond-order differences in the two geometries concur with the geometry of either an open-or a closed-shell state.\nConcurrently, STM images at ionic resonances show molecular orbital densities corresponding to SOMOs for the open-shell geometry, but orbital densities of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) for the closed-shell geometry. Our experimental results are in good agreement with density functional theory (DFT) and multireference perturbation theory calculations.\nFinally, we observe switching between open-and closed-shell states of a single molecule by changing its adsorption site on the surface. Synthetic strategy toward indeno[1,2-a]fluorene. The generation of 5 relies on the solution-phase synthesis of the precursor 7,12-dihydro indeno[1,2-a]fluorene (6). Details on synthesis and characterization of 6 are reported in Supplementary Figs.",
                "Our speculation is based on a previous study of polymers of 1 on Au(111) by Di Giovannantonio et al. , where both tilted and planar individual units of 1 were observed depending on whether the apical carbon atoms of the pentagonal rings in 1 adsorbed on the on-top or hollow sites of the surface, respectively.\nGiven the strong molecule-metal interaction, we found no electronic state signatures of 5 on all three metal surfaces. STM set point for AFM images: V = 0. e, Frontier orbital spectrum of 5 -1 . In the anionic state, \u03c82 becomes doubly occupied and \u03c81 is the SOMO. Filled and empty circles denote occupied and empty orbitals, respectively.\nFor each panel, zero of the energy axis has been aligned to the respective highest-energy occupied orbital.",
                "). Similarly, the NIR corresponds to transitions between 5 0 and 5 -1 . At the NIR onset of 1.3 V, only electron attachment to \u03c82 is energetically possible. At 1.6 V, electron attachment to \u03c81 also becomes possible, and the corresponding STM image shows the superposition of \u03c81 and \u03c82. The observation of the orbital densities of SOMOs, and not the hybridized HOMO and LUMO, proves the open-shell ground state of assigned 5OS.\nMeasurements of the monoradical species with a doublet ground state are shown in Supplementary Fig. . Unexpectedly, another species of 5 was also experimentally observed that exhibited a closedshell ground state. In contrast to 5OS, where the frontier orbitals correspond to the SOMOs \u03c81 and \u03c82, DFT calculations predict orbitals of different shapes and symmetries for 5para and 5ortho, denoted as \u03b1 and \u03b2 and shown in Fig. .\nFor 5ortho, \u03b1 and \u03b2 correspond to HOMO and LUMO, respectively. The orbitals are inverted in energy and occupation for 5para, where \u03b2 is the HOMO and \u03b1 is the LUMO. Fig. shows an AFM image of 5 that we assign as 5para. We experimentally infer its closed-shell state first by using qualitative bond order discrimination by AFM.\nIn high-resolution AFM imaging, chemical bonds with higher bond order are imaged brighter (that is, with higher frequency shift \u0394f) due to stronger repulsive forces, and they appear shorter . In Fig. , we label seven bonds whose bond orders show significant qualitative differences in the calculated 5ortho, 5para (Fig. ) and 5OS (Fig. ) geometries.\nIn 5para, the bonds b and d exhibit a higher bond order than a and c, respectively. This pattern is reversed for 5ortho, while the bond orders of the bonds a-d are all similar and small for 5OS. Furthermore, in 5para bond f exhibits a higher bond order than e, while in 5ortho and 5OS bonds e and f exhibit similar bond order (because they belong to Clar sextets).",
                "Figure shows the DFT-calculated bond lengths of 5OS, where the two salient features, namely, the small difference in the bond lengths within each ring and the notably longer bond lengths in the pentagonal rings, agree with the open-shell resonance structure of 5 (Fig. ). Figure shows an AFM image of 5 adsorbed on bilayer NaCl/Au(111) that we assign as 5OS, where the bond-order differences qualitatively correspond to the calculated 5OS geometry (discussed and compared to the closed-shell state below).\nDifferential conductance spectra (dI/dV(V), where I and V denote the tunneling current and bias voltage, respectively) acquired on assigned 5OS exhibit two peaks centered at -1.5 V and 1.6 V (Fig. ), which we assign to the positive and negative ion resonances (PIR and NIR), respectively. Figure shows the corresponding STM images acquired at the onset (V = -1.2\nV/1.3 V) and the peak (V = -1.5 V/1.6 V) of the ionic resonances. To draw a correspondence between the STM images and the molecular orbital densities, we consider tunneling events as many-body electronic transitions between different charge states of 5OS (Fig. ). Within this framework, the PIR corresponds to transitions between 5 0 and the cationic state 5 .\nAt the onset of the PIR at -1.2 V, an electron can only be detached from the SOMO \u03c81 and the corresponding STM image at -1.2 V shows the orbital density of \u03c81. Increasing the bias to the peak of the PIR at -1.5 V, it becomes possible to also empty the SOMO \u03c82, such that the corresponding STM image shows the superposition of \u03c81 and \u03c82, that is, |\u03c81| 2 + |\u03c82| 2 (ref.",

Recent theoretical work has also shown that indenofluorene-based ladder polymers may exhibit fractionalized excitations.\nFundamentally, indenofluorenes represent model systems to study the interplay between aromaticity and magnetism at the molecular scale . Motivated by many of these prospects, the last decade has witnessed intensive synthetic efforts toward the realization of indenofluorenes. Derivatives of 1-4 have been realized in solution , while 1-3 have also been synthesized on surfaces and characterized using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), which provide information on molecular orbital densities , molecular structure and oxidation state .\nWith regards to the open-shell character of indenofluorenes, 2-4 are theoretically and experimentally interpreted to be closed-shell, while calculations indicate that 1 and 5 should exhibit open-shell ground states . Bulk characterization of mesitylsubstituted 1, including X-ray crystallography, temperature-dependent NMR, and electron spin resonance spectroscopy, provided indications of its open-shell ground state .\nElectronic characterization of 1 on Au(111) surface using scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) revealed a low electronic gap of 0.4 eV (ref. ). However, no experimental proof of an openshell ground state of 1 on Au(111), such as detection of singly occupied molecular orbitals (SOMOs) or spin excitations and correlations due to unpaired electrons , was shown.\nIn this work, we report the generation and characterization of unsubstituted 5. Our research is motivated by theoretical calculations that indicate 5 to exhibit the largest diradical character among all indenofluorene isomers . The same calculations also predict that 5 should possess a triplet ground state.",

Voltage pulses ranging between 4-6 V are applied by the tip of a combined STM/AFM system, which result in cleavage of one C-H bond at each of the pentagonal apices of 6, thereby leading to the generation of 5 (Fig. ).\nIn the main text, we focus on the generation and characterization of 5 on insulating surfaces.

                "To this end, a change in the adsorption site of a molecule was induced by STM imaging at ionic resonances, which often resulted in movement of the molecule. The example presented in Fig. shows a molecule that was switched from 5para to 5OS and back to 5para. The switching is not directed, that is, we cannot choose which of the two species will be formed when changing the adsorption site, and we observed 5OS and 5para in approximately equal yields upon changing the adsorption site.\nThe molecule in Fig. is adsorbed on top of a defect that stabilizes its adsorption geometry on bilayer NaCl. At defect-free adsorption sites on bilayer NaCl, that is, without a third layer NaCl island or atomic defects in the vicinity of the molecule, 5 could be stably imaged neither by AFM nor by STM at ionic resonances (Supplementary Fig. ).\nWithout changing the adsorption site, the state of 5 (open-or closedshell) never changed, including the experiments on bilayer NaCl/Ag(111) and Cu(111), on which the charge state of 5 could be switched (Supplementary Figs. ). Also on these lower work function surfaces, both open-and closed-shell species were observed for 5 0 and both showed charge bistability between 5 0 (5OS or 5para) and 5 -1 (Supplementary Figs. ).\nThe geometrical structure of 5 -1 probed by AFM, and its electronic structure probed by STM imaging at the NIR (corresponding to transitions between 5 -1 and the dianionic state 5 -2 ), are identical within the measurement accuracy for the charged species of both 5OS and 5para. When cycling the charge state of 5 between 5 0 and 5 -1 several times, we always observed the same state (5OS or 5para) when returning to 5 0 , provided the molecule did not move during the charging/discharging process.",
                "Finally, the bond labeled g shows a higher bond order in 5para than in 5ortho and 5OS. The AFM image of assigned 5para shown in Fig. indicates higher bond orders of the bonds b, d and f compared to a, c and e, respectively. In addition, the bond g appears almost point-like and with enhanced \u0394f contrast compared to its neighboring bonds, indicative of a high bond order (see Supplementary Fig. for height-dependent measurements).\nThese observations concur with the calculated 5para geometry (Fig. ). Importantly, all these distinguishing bond-order differences are distinctly different in the AFM image of 5OS shown in Fig. , which is consistent with the calculated 5OS geometry (Fig. ). In the AFM images of 5OS (Fig. and Supplementary Fig. ), the bonds a-d at the pentagon apices appear with similar contrast and apparent bond length.\nThe bonds e and f at one of the terminal benzenoid rings also exhibit similar contrast and apparent bond length, while the central bond g appears longer compared to assigned 5para. Further compelling evidence for the closed-shell state of assigned 5para is obtained by STM and STS. dI/dV(V) spectra acquired on an assigned 5para species exhibit two peaks centered at -1.4 V (PIR) and 1.6 V (NIR) (Fig. ).\nSTM images acquired at these biases (Fig. ) show the orbital densities of \u03b2 (-1.4 V) and \u03b1 (1.6 V). First, the observation of \u03b1 and \u03b2 as the frontier orbitals of this species, and not the SOMOs, strongly indicates its closed-shell state. Second, consistent with AFM measurements that indicate good correspondence to the calculated 5para geometry, we observe \u03b2 as the HOMO and \u03b1 as the LUMO.\nFor 5ortho, \u03b1 should be observed as the HOMO and \u03b2 as the LUMO. We did not observe molecules with the signatures of 5ortho in our experiments. We observed molecules in open-(5OS, Fig. ) and closed-shell (5para, Fig. ) states in similar occurrence after their generation from 6 on the surface. We could also switch individual molecules between open-and closed-shell states as shown in Fig. and Supplementary Fig. .",

Before presenting the experimental findings, we summarize the results of our theoretical calculations performed on 5 in the neutral charge state (denoted as 5 0 ).\nWe start by performing DFT calculations on 5 0 in the gas phase. Geometry optimization performed at the spin-unrestricted UB3LYP/6-31G level of theory leads to one local minimum, 5OS, the geometry of which corresponds to the open-shell resonance structure of 5 (Fig. , the label OS denotes open-shell).\nThe triplet electronic configuration of 5OS is the lowest-energy state, with the openshell singlet configuration 90 meV higher in energy. Geometry optimization performed at the restricted closed-shell RB3LYP/6-31G level reveals two local minima, 5para and 5ortho, the geometries of which (Fig. ) exhibit bond length alternations in line with the presence of a para-or an ortho-QDM moiety, respectively, in the as-indacene core of the closed-shell resonance structures of 5 (Fig. ) .\nRelative to 5OS in the triplet configuration, 5para and 5ortho are 0.40 and 0.43 eV higher in energy, respectively. Additional DFT results are shown in Supplementary Fig. . To gain more accurate insights into the theoretical electronic structure of 5, we performed multireference perturbation theory calculations (Supplementary Fig. ) based on quasi-degenerate second-order n-electron valence state perturbation theory (QD-NEVPT2).",

The convergence criteria were set to 10 \u22124 eV \u00c5 \u22121 for the total forces and 10 \u22126 eV for the total energies.\nMultireference calculations. Multireference calculations were performed on the DFToptimized geometries using the QD-NEVPT2 level of theory , with three singlet roots and one triplet root included in the state-averaged calculation. A (10,10) active space (that is, 10 electrons in 10 orbitals) was used along with the def2-TZVP basis set .\nIncreasing either the active space size or expanding the basis set resulted in changes of about 50 meV for relative energies of the singlet and triplet states. These calculations were performed using the ORCA program package . Nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS) calculations. Isotropic nucleus-independent chemical shift values were evaluated at the centre of each ring using the B3LYP exchangecorrelation functional with def2-TZVP basis set using the Gaussian 16 software package .\nStarting materials (reagent grade) were purchased from TCI and Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification.

                "Based on our experimental observations we conclude that indeno[1,2-a]fluorene (5), the last unknown indenofluorene isomer, can be stabilized in and switched between an open-shell (5OS) and a closed-shell (5para) state on NaCl. For the former, both DFT and QD-NEVPT2 calculations predict a triplet electronic configuration.\nTherefore, 5 can be considered to exhibit the spin-crossover effect, involving magnetic switching between high-spin (5OS) and low-spin (5para) states, coupled with a reversible structural transformation. So far, the spin-crossover effect has mainly only been observed in transition-metal-based coordination compounds with a near-octahedral geometry .\nThe observation that the switching between open-and closedshell states is related to changes in the adsorption site but is not achieved by charge-state cycling alone, indicates that the NaCl surface and local defects facilitate different electronic configurations of 5 depending on the adsorption site.\nGas-phase QD-NEVPT2 calculations predict that 5OS is the ground state, and the closed-shell 5para and 5ortho states are 0.11 and 0.21 eV higher in energy. The experiments, showing bidirectional switching between 5OS and 5para, indicate that a change in the adsorption site can induce sufficient change in the geometry of 5 (leading to a corresponding change in the ground state electronic configuration) and thus induce switching.\nSwitching between open-and closed-shell states in 5 does not require the breaking or formation of covalent bonds , but a change of adsorption site on NaCl where the molecule is physisorbed. Our results should have implications for single-molecule devices, capitalizing on the altered electronic and chemical properties of a system in \u03c0-diradical open-shell and closed-shell states such as frontier orbital and singlet-triplet gaps, and chemical reactivity.",

                "In so far as the order of the ground and excited states are concerned, the results of QD-NEVPT2 calculations qualitatively match with DFT calculations. For 5OS, the triplet configuration remains the lowest-energy state, with the open-shell singlet configuration 60 meV higher in energy. The energy differences between the open-and closed-shell states are substantially reduced in QD-NEVPT2 calculations, with 5para and 5ortho only 0.11 and 0.21 eV higher in energy, respectively, compared to 5OS in the triplet configuration.\nWe also performed nucleus-independent chemical shift calculations to probe local aromaticity of 5 in the openand closed-shell states. While 5OS in the triplet configuration exhibits local aromaticity at the terminal benzenoid rings, 5OS in the open-shell singlet configuration, 5para and 5ortho all display antiaromaticity (Supplementary Fig. ).\nThe choice of the insulating surface determines the charge state of 5: while 5 adopts neutral charge state on the high work function bilayer NaCl/Au(111) surface (irrespective of its openor closed-shell state, Supplementary Fig. ), 5 exhibits charge bistability between 5 0 and the anionic state 5 -1 on the lower work function bilayer NaCl/Ag(111) and Cu(111) surfaces (Supplementary Figs. ).\nIn the main text, we focus on the characterization of 5 on bilayer NaCl/Au(111). Characterization of charge bistable 5 is reported in Supplementary Figs. . We first describe experiments on 5 on bilayer NaCl/Au(111), where 5 exhibits a geometry corresponding to the calculated 5OS geometry, and an open-shell electronic configuration.\nWe compare the experimental data on this species to calculations on 5OS with a triplet configuration, as theory predicts a triplet ground state for 5OS. For 5OS, the calculated frontier orbitals correspond to the SOMOs \u03c81 and \u03c82 (Fig. ), whose spin up levels are occupied and the spin down levels are empty.",
                "Many nonbenzenoid PCHs are also non-alternant, where the presence of odd-membered polycycles breaks the bipartite symmetry of the molecular network . Figure shows classical examples of non-benzenoid non-alternant PCHs, namely, pentalene, azulene and heptalene. Whereas azulene is a stable PCH exhibiting H\u00fcckel aromaticity ([4n+2] \u03c0-electrons, n = 2), pentalene and heptalene are unstable H\u00fcckel antiaromatic compounds with [4n] \u03c0-electrons, n = 2 (pentalene) and n = 3 (heptalene).\nBenzinterposition of pentalene generates indacenes, consisting of two isomers s-indacene and as-indacene (Fig. ). Apart from being antiaromatic, indacenes also contain proaromatic quinodimethane (QDM) moieties (Fig. ) , which endows them with potential open-shell character. While the parent s-indacene and asindacene have never been isolated, stable derivatives of s-indacene bearing bulky substituents have been synthesized .\nA feasible strategy to isolate congeners of otherwise unstable non-benzenoid non-alternant PCHs is through fusion of benzenoid rings at the ends of the \u03c0-system, that is, benzannelation. For example, while the parent pentalene is unstable, the benzannelated congener indeno[2,1-a]indene is stable under ambient conditions (Fig. ) .\nHowever, the position of benzannelation is crucial for stability: although indeno[2,1a]indene is stable, its regioisomer indeno[1,2-a]indene (Fig. ) oxidizes under ambient conditions .

DFT and multireference perturbation theory calculations corroborate these results. Additionally, switching between the two states was observed by altering the molecule's adsorption site on the surface. The synthesis of 5 involves the precursor 7,12-dihydro indeno[1,2-a]fluorene (6).",

Their potential open-shell character makes them attractive for non-linear optical materials and singlet fission in organic photovoltaics. Recent studies suggest indenofluorene-based ladder polymers may exhibit fractionalized excitations. Synthetic efforts have led to the realization of various indenofluorene derivatives, with some characterized using STM and AFM. Theoretical and experimental evidence indicates that certain isomers, like 1 and 5, may have open-shell ground states, while others are closed-shell. This work focuses on unsubstituted 5, predicted to have the largest diradical character and a triplet ground state among indenofluorene isomers.",

The switching between these states is not directed, resulting in approximately equal yields of each. The molecule's stability on bilayer NaCl is influenced by defects, which stabilize its adsorption geometry. The charge state of the molecule (open or closed-shell) remains unchanged without altering the adsorption site. Both open- and closed-shell species exhibit charge bistability on lower work function surfaces. The geometrical and electronic structures of the charged species (5OS and 5para) are identical, and cycling the charge state consistently returns the molecule to the same state if it remains in place during the process.",

The reaction mixture is purified to yield a colorless oil (compound 11). In the second step, another palladium complex (Pd(OAc)2) is added to compound 11, potassium carbonate, and a different ligand (L) in NMP, followed by heating at 160\u00b0C for 4 hours. The final product, compound 6, is obtained as a white solid after purification. The synthesis highlights the use of palladium catalysts and specific ligands to facilitate the formation of the desired compound through controlled reactions and purification processes.",
                "The study demonstrates that indeno[1,2-a]fluorene (5) can be stabilized in both open-shell (5OS) and closed-shell (5para) states on a NaCl surface, exhibiting a spin-crossover effect. This effect involves magnetic switching between high-spin and low-spin states, coupled with structural transformation. Unlike typical spin-crossover observed in transition-metal compounds, this switching in 5 is facilitated by changes in adsorption sites on the NaCl surface rather than charge-state cycling. Theoretical calculations predict 5OS as the ground state in the gas phase, with 5para and 5ortho being higher in energy. The experimental observation of bidirectional switching suggests that altering the adsorption site can induce significant geometric changes in 5, leading to a shift in the ground state electronic configuration. This mechanism, which does not involve breaking or forming covalent bonds, has potential implications for single-molecule devices, leveraging the altered electronic and chemical properties of \u03c0-diradical open-shell and closed-shell states.",

Carbon monoxide (CO)-functionalized tips were used for all measurements, with AFM operating in non-contact mode and STM in constant-current mode. Spectroscopy data were processed using Gaussian low-pass filters. Surfaces of Au(111), Ag(111), and Cu(111) were cleaned and coated with NaCl, resulting in bilayer and trilayer islands. Sub-monolayer coverage of molecules was achieved by flashing an oxidized silicon wafer, and CO molecules were used for tip functionalization. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the PSI4 program package.",

For 5OS, the triplet state remains the lowest energy, with the open-shell singlet 60 meV higher. Energy differences between open and closed-shell states are reduced in QD-NEVPT2, with 5para and 5ortho being 0.11 and 0.21 eV higher than 5OS triplet. Nucleus-independent chemical shift calculations show local aromaticity in 5OS triplet and antiaromaticity in other states. The charge state of 5 depends on the insulating surface: neutral on high work function NaCl/Au(111), and bistable between neutral and anionic on lower work function NaCl/Ag(111) and Cu(111). Experiments on 5 on NaCl/Au(111) confirm the predicted 5OS triplet ground state, with matching frontier orbitals.",
                "Non-benzenoid non-alternant polycyclic hydrocarbons (PCHs) like pentalene, azulene, and heptalene lack bipartite symmetry due to odd-membered polycycles. Azulene is stable and H\u00fcckel aromatic, while pentalene and heptalene are unstable and H\u00fcckel antiaromatic. Indacenes, formed by benzinterposition of pentalene, are antiaromatic and contain proaromatic quinodimethane moieties, potentially giving them open-shell character. Stable derivatives of s-indacene have been synthesized, but the parent compounds remain elusive. Benzannelation, or fusion of benzenoid rings at the ends of the \u03c0-system, can stabilize otherwise unstable PCHs. For instance, indeno[2,1-a]indene is stable, while its regioisomer indeno[1,2-a]indene is not. Benzannelation of indacenes yields indenofluorenes, which are the focus of this work.",

The first step involves a palladium complex reacting with 1,3-dibromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, boronic acid, potassium carbonate, and a ligand (XPhos) in toluene, yielding a colorless oil (compound 11). The second step uses another palladium complex with compound 11, potassium carbonate, and a different ligand (L) in NMP, resulting in compound 6 as a white solid after purification.\n\n2. **Polymer Behavior on Metal Surface**: The study examines the behavior of polymer 1 on Au(111) based on previous research, which observed both tilted and planar units depending on the adsorption site of the pentagonal rings' apical carbon atoms. The strong molecule-metal interaction led to the absence of electronic state signatures of 5 on all three metal surfaces. In the anionic state, \u03c82 becomes doubly occupied, and \u03c81 is the SOMO, with the energy axis aligned to the highest-energy occupied orbital.\n\nIn summary, the main themes are the detailed synthesis process of compound 6 using palladium catalysts and ligands, and the observed behavior of polymer 1 on a gold surface, including its electronic states and interactions with the metal."

Conducted by a team including Shantanu Mishra, Manuel Vilas-Varela, Leonard-Alexander Lieske, Ricardo Ortiz, Igor Ron\u010devi\u0107, Florian Albrecht, Diego Pe\u00f1a, and Leo Gross, the study explores the implications of this bistability for molecular electronics and quantum computing. Advanced spectroscopic and computational techniques, such as Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and scanning probe microscopy, are employed to characterize the transition between these states.\n\nThe research includes detailed characterizations of both the open-shell (5OS) and closed-shell (5) indeno[1,2-a]fluorene molecules on bilayer NaCl/Au(111) and NaCl/Cu(111) surfaces. Key findings include:\n\n- **Open-Shell (5OS) Characterization:**\n  - DFT-calculated wave functions and spin density distribution of the frontier orbitals.\n  - Probability density of the Single Occupied Molecular Orbitals (SOMOs).\n  - Bond lengths and constant-height I(V) and dI/dV spectra.\n  - Many-body transitions associated with ionic resonances, visualized through STM images.\n  - Laplace-filtered AFM images showing the molecule's position relative to NaCl islands.\n\n- **Closed-Shell (5) Characterization:**\n  - DFT-calculated wave functions of the frontier orbitals for different geometries (5para and 5ortho).\n  - Bond lengths and constant-height I(V) and dI/dV spectra for 5para.\n  - Many-body transitions associated with ionic resonances of 5para, visualized through STM images.\n  - Laplace-filtered AFM images showing the switching between 5OS and 5para on different surfaces.\n  - Comparison of bond orders between 5para and 5ortho, highlighting specific bonds with higher bond orders in 5para.\n\nThe study provides a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and structural properties of indeno[1,2-a]fluorene in various states and adsorption configurations, supported by theoretical calculations and experimental measurements.",
                    "The summaries cover three main themes: chemical analysis of compounds, machine learning model optimization, and the properties of indenofluorenes.\n\n1. **Chemical Analysis of Compounds**:\n   - Two compounds are analyzed using NMR and MS techniques. The first compound has a molecular formula of C\u2082\u2080H\u2081\u2086Cl\u2082 with signals indicating the presence of aromatic and aliphatic protons and carbons. The second compound has a molecular formula of C\u2082\u2080H\u2081\u2084, with a molecular ion peak at m/z 254, indicating a complex aromatic structure.\n\n2. **Machine Learning Model Optimization**:\n   - A study emphasizes the importance of feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and data preprocessing in enhancing machine learning model accuracy and efficiency. Optimal techniques in these areas significantly improve model performance, while inadequate preprocessing can lead to suboptimal results.\n\n3. **Properties of Indenofluorenes**:\n   - Indenofluorenes, non-benzenoid conjugated hydrocarbons, are studied for their unique electronic structure and potential applications in nonlinear optics and photovoltaics. The synthesis of unsubstituted indeno[1,2-a]fluorene is reported, showing charge bistability on different surfaces and the possibility of existing in either an open-shell \u03c0-diradical state or a closed-shell state. The incorporation of non-benzenoid carbocyclic rings can modify the physicochemical properties of polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons.\n\nThese themes collectively highlight advancements in chemical analysis, machine learning optimization, and the exploration of novel materials with unique electronic properties.",
                    "The study focuses on the synthesis, characterization, and electronic properties of indenofluorenes, particularly the unsubstituted isomer 5, which is predicted to have the largest diradical character and a triplet ground state among indenofluorene isomers. Indenofluorenes are derived from indacenes, which are antiaromatic and contain proaromatic quinodimethane (QDM) moieties, potentially giving them open-shell character. Benzannelation, or fusion of benzenoid rings, stabilizes otherwise unstable polycyclic hydrocarbons (PCHs) like indacenes.\n\nMolecule 5, a Kekul\u00e9 triplet, exhibits two distinct ground states\u2014open-shell and closed-shell\u2014on insulating surfaces, as revealed by high-resolution AFM and STM imaging. Switching between these states can be induced by altering the molecule's adsorption site. The synthesis of 5 involves the precursor 7,12-dihydro indeno[1,2-a]fluorene (6), which is cleaved on coinage metal and insulating surfaces to generate 5.\n\nTheoretical calculations using DFT and multireference perturbation theory (QD-NEVPT2) confirm that the open-shell resonance structure (5OS) with a triplet electronic configuration is the lowest-energy state for 5. Experimental exploration on bilayer NaCl films on coinage metal surfaces supports these theoretical findings, showing that 5OS remains the ground state. The study also investigates the electronic structure of 5, revealing differences in bond lengths and molecular orbital densities that correspond to the open-shell resonance structure.\n\nOverall, the work highlights the potential of indenofluorenes, especially 5, for applications in organic electronic devices due to their low frontier orbital gap, excellent electrochemical properties, and potential open-shell character, making them attractive for non-linear optical materials and singlet fission in organic photovoltaics.",

                "Our main difficulty with our daughter is her overwhelming obsession to use her cell phone (and to a lesser extent her laptop) constantly. Without any restriction, she will be on it every minute of the day, and will be awake until the early hours every day. We have tried to incorporate her input around rules as to when she has to give in her phone, but she is unwilling to compromise on a time that she should give it to us, believing that she should have unlimited use. I believe she is unable to do any adequate study or homework, as she is constantly having to look at the phone. We have tried to put rules in place that she has to give in her phone and laptop on school nights at 22:15. If she is able to do this then she is given rewards, and if she doesn't then she knows that there will be consequences. The consequence has been restricted use the following day. However, this is usually where we fail, because taking her phone away from her results in tantrums, screaming, and even threatening to harm herself. This behaviour is relentless to the point where the whole family becomes deeply distressed, and inevitably results in her getting the phone back.\nThis obsession is affecting her schoolwork, and more severely her eyesight. She has become very shortsighted, and her eyesight continues to deteriorate as a result of holding the phone or laptop very close, and mostly in the dark without any lights on. My husband and I have a constant battle on our hands daily, in all areas of discipline with our daughter, but our main concern is that we have been unable to find a way to minimise this obsessive behaviour centred around her phone and laptop. Please can you provide some strategies that can help us specifically with this problem.\nFirst of all, I thank you for developing this program and I am only at the first stage of assignment 1. I have loads of books I have bought, attended psychiatrists for my son and myself, family therapy, occupational therapy, begged and prayed for change but have been dealing with behavioural issues for so long I am definitely exhausted and resentful.",
                "The second problem is leaving the house for school. Patrick refuses personal hygiene (either morning or night) and any request to even brush his teeth is fraught with swearing and abuse. If I can get him to shower, he will watch the water roll down the drain and turn up the water really high temp (mu husband has had to turn down the thermostat on the hot water service) without so much as getting wet. My husband leaves for work at 6am but I leave at 745 to work as a nurse in a busy outpatients department in the Alfred Hospital (Melbourne). My work is my sanity as it is a paid break from home but most days I am late which is causing considerable stress and anxiety not to mention my responsibility to do my job. Patrick simply refuses to leave the house and as much as I am tempted to just walk out and leave I know the house would be left unlocked and wonder if Patrick would even attend school. The time I need to leave is not negotiable but Patrick uses this to his advantage and seems to delight in stressing me out and subsequently speeding to work in a frazzled mess.\nThe interesting and frustrating element in all of this is that although he is socially isolated at school (he has no friends) and academically challenged his behaviour at school is not a problem. He is quiet and his teachers report he does his best and is compliant and well mannered. It is like a Jekyll and Hyde situation where another side of him at home is so angry and abusive yet at school this behaviour does not happen.\nI\u2019m Jackie, I now work primarily as a freelance tech writer, after starting my career in software development and moving on to teach IT to young adults at a variety of colleges and schools.",

I think you for taking the time to write this and sharing your insights as well as the experiences of many of your clients. It has really helped me understand the last 32 years of our marriage and get a grasp on how to move forward.\nOne area that is of primary concern to me, that I did not see addressed, is stimming. I believe that is the behavior my husband is showing through constant vocal singing, repetition of words, shouting out, as well as slapping himself in the chest and general nervous activity. It is very loud and disruptive to our household and it is often a relief when he is not at home. I think there may be a level of Tourette's syndrome as well.\nI did some searches on the Internet and could not find anything that really describes his behavior. Most of what I found was flapping or children's behavior. I understand that it is a release of nervous tension but I am really trying to find some strategies to help him stop this behavior as it is extremely frustrating and builds my resentment in dealing with it daily. A lot of it is embarrassing as well and sounds childish to me.\nHe usually does this when close family members are around and will reign himself in if he is around other people besides us. When we are home it is constant. He also has a lot of anger, mostly at himself, and blows up at unimportant things, it is as if he has a ton of negative energy inside him that need to get out and stimming is one outlet.\nI will try to build my acceptance of it, but I also would just like him to stop especially the loudest and most annoying portions. Would you have any resources you could point me to?",
                "My son just turned 15 and is a freshman in high school. Although this is his first year in a general ed environment, he is struggling with behaviors in school. He has meltdowns and does not express why he would have them until much later. Once we all know what caused it, the school will accommodate him and try to \"change up\" things so as not to cause his meltdown. Once that is resolved, another issue comes up and causes him to melt down. He is a high functioning and academically does well, when he wants to do the work. We battle at home over homework. He does not care how it is done, as long as he hands it in. He thinks failing a test is ok, at least he took the test. Homework is never on his mind when he gets home from school. If I never prompt him, he would never open is backpack. He can be aggressive but is never intentionally trying to hurt anyone. He may push over a chair in school, but it is not directed at anyone. We know how that in itself could hurt someone who gets hit by it though. He is defiant in that he only wants to do what interests him. He does not go out by himself (still immature), or abuse alcohol or drugs and never curses. He is a very funny kid and very talented. His main problems are task avoidance and seeking attention. He can be disrespectful to adults in that he is \"cheeky\" with them, trying to be funny or cute. And he has no \"filters\".\nI\u2019ve just finished reading your Living with an Aspergers Partner ebook. I found it so informative, thank you.\nYou offered some personal advise, and i wanted to run a situation past you and seek your input as to a strategy for what to do next.\nI\u2019ve been seeing a guy for about 7 months now who I believe has Aspergers. I came to this conclusion months ago and I don\u2019t think he realizes, (or acknowledges) although he is aware he has some traits.",
                "We noticed some things with our son, Taylor, as a yound child but as we had not heard of Aspergers at that time we just did what we thought would help him. As a toddler and a child at pre-school he generally went off on his own to play. When I talked to his pre-school teacher about my concerns (that I was worried he would end up a hermit) she said she did not see him being a loner and that he seemed to interact fine with others in many situations. We worked with him on making eye contact when talking with others. We explained different emotions in people's faces and mannerisms to help him know how to interact with others. We discussed the fact that people would say things that did not mean what they souneded like - such as \"I'm so hungry I could eat a horse\". As we did these things he worked hard to better understand communication with others.\nDuring his 4th grade year I had a teacher from the gifted program ask me if I had ever heard of Aspergers. I told her that I had not heard of it. She proceeded to read me some of the charateristics and so many of them described my son. So we had him tested by the school district during the summer between 4th and 5th grade and they did find that he had Aspergers but that he was high functioning. We then set him up with and EIP which stayed with him until his sophomore year. We pulled him from it at that time because we had moved and the new district was requiring him to take one class a day that was a study class. This reduced the number of required classes he could take and he was doing fine with his studies at the time.\nIt was during the 2nd half of his Junior year that we noticed some of his grades going down. Then during his Senior year is when he started skipping classes and not doing assignments. We had not realized it before then but we soon became aware that he was addicted to gaming. He would go to the library or somewhere else on campus and play games on the computer rather than go to class. It was also at this time that he began lying about his actions (so as not to get in trouble).",
                "I don't know how to help him with it and because he's almost 19 I have limited control now. It's made my life easier knowing what we're dealing with and I think his life would be easier is he accepted it.\nPlease help me help him.\nI am a clinical psychologist in NYC who now has several (!!) children I see who have RAD. In 20 years of practice, I\u2019d seen only one case. Now, I have at least three children with this. I have no training, per se, in working with this children though I know about setting structure, consistency, etc. I do a lot of work with parents about parenting. I work primarily within the school setting in a charter school whose mission is to educate children on the autism spectrum in a mainstream setting. We use Michelle Garcia Winner\u2019s social thinking program with our ASD kids. I also work with gen ed kids in the school who are at-risk; the school is in the inner city from where the majority of our non-ASD kids live.\nIt would have been so much easier to mention to my adult son that I think (I know he does, but want to ease into the subject)\nhe has Asperger's when we were living together two years ago. He has since moved to Tennessee working in his field of interest\nwhich is 3-D printing and software development. I am so happy for him that he has found his way into a job that he truly enjoys\neven though he's socially isolated.\nHe's not diagnosed and does not know he has it. How I know is his classic symptoms being sensory issues (fabric feeling like sandpaper)\ncommunication difficulties, meltdowns and much more. Throughout his childhood I just felt he was a bit different. Nothing major stood out and time\njust passes, misdiagnosis of ADHD, low frustration, etc. We've talked about his ADHD numerous times (which I now know he doesn't have).\nIt's so much easier to communicate with him now that I know he has Asperger's. I keep it \"slow and low\" in talking, with long moments\nof silence and then we connect. It's really too bad that Asperger's got a diagnostic code back in the 90's, yet all the so called doctors,\nphysiologist's, etc, didn't know how to diagnose it. Too bad.",
                "My son and myself are interested in a inpatient Aspergers program. We line in Calif which is preferable. My son is very high functioning and was diagnosed dry late. He was eight years old. He has never been in or attended a full day of class. Partially due to depression,anxiety, and trouble with his ADHD also his aversion and being bullied and of course his Aspergers. He will not attend his freshmen year due to surgery on both Achilles' tendons from walking on his toes. With physical therapy he should be ready by his sophomore year! We all feel he needs in patient therapy to give him the tools on how to work with his issues in a structured setting and a place that will give him tools for the rest of his life.\nIn my utter desperation to find a way to get some help for my daughter's increasingly challenging behaviour I trawled the internet to see if I could find some strategies that would provide specific methods on dealing with teenagers with Asperger's syndrome. When I came across your website, I couldn't believe that every statement you made was exactly what I have been going through with my daughter. She has just turned 14 last week, and was diagnosed with Asperger's/ Autism Spectrum Disorder 15 months ago. I have already been seeing a child psychologist for the past five months, however the methods she has been advising have not been very effective.",
                "Based on his grades and his ACT score he received offers from colleges for full tuition scholarships. He chose the college where he had taken concurrent classes during his high school years. But he proceeded to skip class and not turn in assignments so he lost his scholarship and quit attending college. During this time he was only able to find employment through an employment agency where he was mostly sent to manuel labor type jobs (which is not something he enjoys but he did it anyway). It was during this time that at one place had gone to on numerous occasions he was told if he came late one more time they would tell the emplyment agency they did not want him to come there anymore. (This seemed to make an impression on him because he has continued to be reliable and responsbile at his places of employment).\nAt 19 1/2 he left to serve a 2 year full-time mission for our church. He completed his mission successfully. (I don't think it was without some struggle, stress and depression, but he was able to pick himself up and move on from those times).\nWhen he came home he started working for the employment agency again but began looking for employment elsewhere. He got a job at a local Chick Fil-A where he has worked for 3 years. He started college again shortly after he came home but as before it was short lived. He did finish out the semester but failed most of the classes due to his skipping class and not turning in assignments. When he skipped class he would usually sleep in his car.\nTaylor's life consists of working (where to the best of our knowledge) he does well, he is reliable and his employer likes him. When he comes home from work he either sleeps or plays video games or other games - such as kakuro. He spendes most of his time in the basement where his bedroom is and this is where he games. Taylor owns his own car, bought his own laptop and very rarely spends money. He pays us $200 /month to still live at home, unloads the dishwasher on a regular basis and does the weekly garbage. However, his room is a mess and he only cleans his bathroom when I tell him he needs to clean it.",
                "Carli who is 10 years old and has had behavioral issues her whole life. The other night she came home very upset after having a conflict with a friend. She was at her friend's house and her and her friend wanted to get on the computer and the older sister was using it. Carli made up a story that someone was at the door to get the older sister off the computer. Her friend didn't understand that she was making up a story to get the sister off the computer. She got excited that someone was at the door and ran downstairs to answer the door. In the process of getting the door, she fell and yelled at Carli. Carli became extremely upset. She was able to control her feelings at her friend's house, but when she came home, she proceeded to cry extremely loudly for over an hour. Her dad spent most of that time with her, talking to her and trying to calm her down. After an hour, I asked him if he could please tell her to be more quiet because the other members of the household were trying to go to sleep.\nMy question is....how do I as the girlfriend, handle this? He did not like that I asked her to be quiet. We have a rule that if she is having bad behavior, and can't calm down in 5 minutes, he takes her out of the house because her yelling doesn't stop for a long time and is very upsetting to everyone in the household. I would like to ask him to do this with this kind of situation as well. Is this a reasonable request? His thought was that she shouldn't be made to calm down, because everyone handles being upset in a different way. But, she was literally sobbing and wailing very loudly.\nMy other question is should she have been told that if she wouldn't have lied, this wouldn't have happened? She has a history of lying and of not accepting responsibility for her actions. My boyfriend became very upset with me when I brought this up. He was being very sympathetic and understanding to her. I feel like he was giving her negative attention, and being an over indulgent parent by not putting his foot gown and saying, \"you can't carry on like this, even though you are upset\". Please let me know how we can handle these situations better.",

I am hopeful your programme can make life better for all of us but I wonder if it is too early to ask you two questions?\nThe first lies with what to do when Patrick goes into my other son Brendan\u2019s room and will either turn on a light when he is sleeping, yell when he is on his phone or create some disturbance. He will not leave the room when asked to do so and the situation always escalates into yelling and Brendan attempting to physically remove him.

                "I just listed to your tapes on dealing with an out of control, defiant teen. I'd like to ask your advice on a particular situation we have. Our 15 year old daughter is smoking pot almost every day at school. Because we had no way to control the situation, we told her, fine, go ahead and smoke weed. However, you will no longer receive the same support from us. You will not have your phone, lunch money to go off campus (she has an account at the school for the cafeteria she can use), and you will be grounded until you can pass a drug test. We will not be testing you except for when you tell us you are ready to be tested. She is now saying she's suicidal because she feels so isolated, yet she continues to smoke weed. In fact, she tried to sneak out last night but was foiled by our alarm system. For the particular drug test we have, I read it takes about 10 days of not smoking to pass the test. What would you do? Please advise.\nI am having a problem with my 18 year old son, Danny, with high functioning autism. We finally had him diagnosed when he was 16 years old. I always knew something was going on with him but the doctors misdiagnosed him as bipolar. It's been 2 years now and he will not accept his diagnosis. He won't talk about it and when I try to bring it up he gets very angry. I've tried telling him that it's not a bad thing, that there's been many, many very successful people with Aspergers. He won't tell anyone and refuses to learn about managing life with it. He once shared with me that the other kids at school use it as an insult, like saying someone is so autistic when they do something they don't approve of. So he doesn't want anyone to know. He's turned down services that could help him. He has a girlfriend, going on 8 months. He won't tell her and they're having problems arguing a lot and I wonder if it would help for her to know.\nI'm sad that he thinks it's a life sentence to something horrible instead of accepting, embracing it and learning about it more so he maybe can understand why he's struggling. I told him that he doesn't need to shout it out to the whole world but he won't even accept it himself.",

                "I am contacting you for help with adult AS. I am taking initiative to pre screen potential therapists to help my current boyfriend get therapy and help with Adult AS.\nHe has seen many therapists, but it seems like they aren\u2019t really helping him with his problems. They don\u2019t seem to understand how his (undiagnosed) AS would affect therapy approaches. For example, he may not share enough in therapy session and I\u2019m assuming an AS therapist would recognize that is part of the AS and employ strategies to get information from him that helps with treatment. Sometime he tunes out when he is processing something heavy or that he doesn\u2019t want to hear necessarily, or he gets distracted and I\u2019m hoping an As therapist would recognize that and get that he may need repeated something for example, if this is happening.\nHe is currently suffering from depression that appears clinical in nature as well as reoccurring negative thoughts about something specific that has been worrying him about our relationship. Today he told me these reoccurring thoughts happen during all waking hours unless he watches TV, he never gets a break from them and they make him feel like he is going crazy. As his girlfriend, I am extremely concerned that he cannot get relief from these thoughts and that the therapists he is seeing are unable to help him with his problems. Therefore, I am taking initiative to try and help him find better therapy options, because I want to see him someone who can better help him get to the bottom of things and help him with the challenges he is facing. He really needs an advocate that will help him go deep to figure things out and not just assume therapies are working well, without seeing changes or getting supporting feedback from him in that regard.\nHere are some questions I am trying to ask in advance to find the right people to help us with this. As you may know, insurance for these therapies are not often available. We don\u2019t have a lot of money to go from therapist to therapist to find the right person and are hoping prescreening will help.",
                "We have just completed the first week and beginning week two of your material. We are agreeing with your take and see our son and ourselves in most of what you are saying. Prior to finding your material and starting your program we had been having extreme out of control behaviors and had to call the police because he was breaking things in our house and pushed my husband. This happened three weeks ago. After that incident we took away privileges ie. PS4, phone (which had already been taken for a few days), and friends. So, last week while doing your program he already didn\u2019t have privileges and has continued with poor behavior \u2013 name calling, throwing things, slamming doors. We are not sure when to give privileges back. He has been given the privilege of playing with friends on occasion. His 13th birthday is tomorrow. This past weekend, for his birthday my husband and he went boar hunting. Of course we debated about it but decided to go ahead since it was his bday. We are cooking some of the meet on the grill tomorrow night for his bday and inviting a couple of his friends over for a cookout. No more gifts other than cards and balloons. We are wondering if we should go ahead and give him his privileges back and not sure how to do it. Last Friday morning we attempted to talk giving him a date to return privileges and that conversation ended with him getting angry but he gathered from our conversation that he is getting his stuff back on his bday. We are starting week 2 assignments today but not sure how to handle what was already in place. Of course, we aren\u2019t seeing the respect and responsibility we are looking for but realize it has been a long time. We were wanting him to pay for his phone and thought it might be a good time to introduce that idea. Allowing him to earn his phone.

He went through an anger management course and now is in substance abuse classes. Kyle continues to verbally abusive to me and blame me for everything.

                "Taylor used to read quite a bit and loved to learn. It has just been in his adult years that he has not read as much - I think because of his gaming addiction.

In Sunday class room settings he stays awake - I think because he is able to particpate in discussions.\nTaylor has only had 2 real friends since entering Junior High school. And as of now he only keeps in contact with one of them who still lives in Georgia. We have lived in Utah since the summer of 2007 and he has never had a friend to do things with since we have lived here. He has two younger siblings, a brother 22 and a sister 20. They love Taylor and spend time with him when they are home. They are both at college and doing well.\nThroughout Taylor's school years he has seen a counsleor on a fairly regular basis. One summer during junior high he attended a weekly class where he interacted with other kids with Aspergers. We did see a lot of change in him from this group. After he returned from his mission he went to see a counselor for a short period - this counselor tried to help him with some social skills. His dad and I went with him the first 3 or 4 times but we found out that after we quit going with him he only went a few more times and then scheduled appointments but did not show a couple of the times. We only found this out when a bill came for a \"no show\" appointment.\nI don't know if this is too much information but were are in dire need of help for him.

                "My Aspergers Child: COMMENTS & QUESTIONS [for Feb., 2017]\nI emailed you a while back and you mentioned that I could email when I needed to. Thank you. I last wrote you in December that my son became involved in a dispute involving the local police. We have had 3 court dates. It keeps delaying due to not being able to come to an agreement. But the attorney, even though he was just vaguely familiar with Aspergers, has been very good with Craig. He has the compassion and excellence that is needed here. What started out very bad is turning into a good thing. It will probably take another 90 days or more.\nBut Craig is working hard. Too hard sometimes. He goes to therapy 3 times a week. Doing excellent. He's more focused and can calm down easier. He's got a lot on his plate but has support from his family. From his attorney. From therapy. And from his work.\nHe has been renting a room from a lady who has a son with ADHD. It is good for him. I'm a little worried though because since she smokes he wants to find his own place. With all the costs he has to balance it out financially. That is good. I can't help him more than I am which is good. He is stepping up and taking responsibility. He is listening much better.\nHe is going to have an evaluation today to get an accurate diagnosis. I understand that is a little difficult since he is an adult. Also the PTSD may cover it over. The attorney stated it would help to have the diagnosis.\nAware this is a long update, but thanks for reading. I am fighting much guilt still but I have a lot of peace now. My daughter and her 4 year old son also have Aspergers symptoms. So my life chapters may not close for a while. :-)\nMy name is Mac. I'm sure you're quite busy, so I'll get right to it I just wanted to pass on compliments on My Aspergers Child and your post, How to Implement the GFCF Diet: Tips for Parents of Autistic Children.\nMe and my wife absolutely loved it!",
                "He walked out last year after I discovered he had been visiting massage parlours and developed a relationship with an illegal Chinese escourt whom he subsequently moved in with. He had been seeing this woman behind my back for over 18 months. The pain of all this indescribable and his dismissal of my pain and very existence beyond belief.\nLeading up to this I had been battling anxiety and depression which my husband found very hard to cope with.\nOver the years of our relationship I knew something was off but I just could not put my finger on it. I often felt a complete lack of validation and empathy. Communication was also difficult as my husband was defensive and unwilling to look at issues in our marriage.\nPlease Mark could you help me validate some of this pain and try and make dense of 27 years of my life without drowning in fear guilt and despair about my future.\nThank you for listening and your site.\nI have had problems with drunkenness, being late for school, not handing in school work, buying pot from a dealer etc. I chose to focus on the drinking and did the grounding then (grounding happened 3 times). I also stopped sleep overs at friends 100%. I have stopped handing out money for no reason or even buying treats like chocolate.\nI did lose it one evening (and didn't do the poker face) when I was trying to unplug the internet at midnight on a school night (she\u2019s always late for school so I am trying to get her to sleep at a reasonable hour). I was physically stopped and pushed around so I slapped my daughter (it was not hard). This ended up with her saying she didn\u2019t want to come home (the next day after school). By this stage, I also had enough and didn\u2019t go get her. I thought I am not begging. You will run out of money soon. It was quite a relief to have some peace. Daughter\u2019s Dad was in town (from another country) and called a family meeting with the counsellor. To cut a long story short, daughter and her counsellor put it on the table that daughter wants to go live somewhere else (with her friends family) because of the stress at home with me (we live on our own) (i.e. stricter rules and her bucking up against it)."

                "At this time[update], 17 human proteins with Gla domains have been discovered, and they play key roles in the regulation of three physiological processes:\nBlood coagulation: prothrombin (factor II), factors VII, IX, and X, and proteins C, S, and Z[31]\nBone metabolism: osteocalcin, also called bone Gla protein (BGP), matrix Gla protein (MGP),[32] periostin,[33] and the recently discovered Gla-rich protein (GRP).[34][35]\nVascular biology: growth arrest-specific protein 6 (Gas6)[36]\nUnknown function: proline-rich \u03b3-carboxyglutamyl proteins (PRGPs) 1 and 2, and transmembrane \u03b3-carboxy glutamyl proteins (TMGs) 3 and 4.[37]\nLike other lipid-soluble vitamins (A, D and E), vitamin K is stored in the fatty tissue of the human body.\nAbsorption and dietary need[edit]\nPrevious theory held that dietary deficiency is extremely rare unless the small intestine was heavily damaged, resulting in malabsorption of the molecule. Another at-risk group for deficiency were those subject to decreased production of K2 by normal intestinal microbiota, as seen in broad spectrum antibiotic use.[38] Taking broad-spectrum antibiotics can reduce vitamin K production in the gut by nearly 74% in people compared with those not taking these antibiotics.[39] Diets low in vitamin K also decrease the body's vitamin K concentration.[40] Those with chronic kidney disease are at risk for vitamin K deficiency, as well as vitamin D deficiency, and particularly those with the apoE4 genotype.[41] Additionally, in the elderly there is a reduction in vitamin K2 production.[42]",

                "Adequate intake of vitamin K is associated with the inhibition of arterial calcification and stiffening,[6] but there have been few interventional studies and no good evidence that vitamin K supplementation is of any benefit in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.[7]\nOne 10-year population study, the Rotterdam Study, did show a clear and significant inverse relationship between the highest intake levels of menaquinone (mainly MK-4 from eggs and meat, and MK-8 and MK-9 from cheese) and cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in older men and women.[8]\nVitamin K has been promoted in supplement form with claims it can slow tumor growth; there is however no good medical evidence that supports such claims.[9]\nCoumarin poisoning[edit]\nVitamin K is part of the suggested treatment regime for poisoning by rodenticide (coumarin poisoning).[10]\nAlthough allergic reaction from supplementation is possible, no known toxicity is associated with high doses of the phylloquinone (vitamin K1) or menaquinone (vitamin K2) forms of vitamin K, so no tolerable upper intake level (UL) has been set.[11]\nBlood clotting (coagulation) studies in humans using 45 mg per day of vitamin K2 (as MK-4)[12] and even up to 135 mg per day (45 mg three times daily) of K2 (as MK-4),[13] showed no increase in blood clot risk. Even doses in rats as high as 250 mg/kg, body weight did not alter the tendency for blood-clot formation to occur.[14]\nUnlike the safe natural forms of vitamin K1 and vitamin K2 and their various isomers, a synthetic form of vitamin K, vitamin K3 (menadione), is demonstrably toxic at high levels. The U.S. FDA has banned this form from over-the-counter sale in the United States because large doses have been shown to cause allergic reactions, hemolytic anemia, and cytotoxicity in liver cells.[2]",
                "Warfarin and other 4-hydroxycoumarins block the action of VKOR.[60] This results in decreased concentrations of vitamin K and vitamin K hydroquinone in tissues, such that the carboxylation reaction catalyzed by the glutamyl carboxylase is inefficient. This results in the production of clotting factors with inadequate Gla. Without Gla on the amino termini of these factors, they no longer bind stably to the blood vessel endothelium and cannot activate clotting to allow formation of a clot during tissue injury. As it is impossible to predict what dose of warfarin will give the desired degree of clotting suppression, warfarin treatment must be carefully monitored to avoid overdose.\nGamma-carboxyglutamate proteins[edit]\nMain article: Gla domain\nThe following human Gla-containing proteins (\"Gla proteins\") have been characterized to the level of primary structure: blood coagulation factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, and X, anticoagulant proteins C and S, and the factor X-targeting protein Z. The bone Gla protein osteocalcin, the calcification-inhibiting matrix Gla protein (MGP), the cell growth regulating growth arrest specific gene 6 protein (Gas6), and the four transmembrane Gla proteins (TMGPs), the function of which is at present unknown. Gas6 can function as a growth factor to activate the Axl receptor tyrosine kinase and stimulate cell proliferation or prevent apoptosis in some cells. In all cases in which their function was known, the presence of the Gla residues in these proteins turned out to be essential for functional activity.\nGla proteins are known to occur in a wide variety of vertebrates: mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish. The venom of a number of Australian snakes acts by activating the human blood-clotting system. In some cases, activation is accomplished by snake Gla-containing enzymes that bind to the endothelium of human blood vessels and catalyze the conversion of procoagulant clotting factors into activated ones, leading to unwanted and potentially deadly clotting.",
                "The precise function of vitamin K was not discovered until 1974, when three laboratories (Stenflo et al.,[87] Nelsestuen et al.,[88] and Magnusson et al.[89]) isolated the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor prothrombin (factor II) from cows that received a high dose of a vitamin K antagonist, warfarin. It was shown that, while warfarin-treated cows had a form of prothrombin that contained 10 glutamate (Glu) amino acid residues near the amino terminus of this protein, the normal (untreated) cows contained 10 unusual residues that were chemically identified as \u03b3-carboxyglutamate (Gla). The extra carboxyl group in Gla made clear that vitamin K plays a role in a carboxylation reaction during which Glu is converted into Gla.\nThe biochemistry of how vitamin K is used to convert Glu to Gla has been elucidated over the past thirty years in academic laboratories throughout the world.",

                "Many bacteria, such as Escherichia coli found in the large intestine, can synthesize vitamin K2 (menaquinone-7 or MK-7, up to MK-11),[70] but not vitamin K1 (phylloquinone). In these bacteria, menaquinone transfers two electrons between two different small molecules, during oxygen-independent metabolic energy production processes (anaerobic respiration).[71] For example, a small molecule with an excess of electrons (also called an electron donor) such as lactate, formate, or NADH, with the help of an enzyme, passes two electrons to menaquinone. The menaquinone, with the help of another enzyme, then transfers these two electrons to a suitable oxidant, such fumarate or nitrate (also called an electron acceptor). Adding two electrons to fumarate or nitrate converts the molecule to succinate or nitrite plus water, respectively.\nSome of these reactions generate a cellular energy source, ATP, in a manner similar to eukaryotic cell aerobic respiration, except the final electron acceptor is not molecular oxygen, but fumarate or nitrate. In aerobic respiration, the final oxidant is molecular oxygen (O2), which accepts four electrons from an electron donor such as NADH to be converted to water. E. coli, as facultative anaerobes, can carry out both aerobic respiration and menaquinone-mediated anaerobic respiration.\nInjection in newborns[edit]\nThe blood clotting factors of newborn babies are roughly 30\u201360% that of adult values; this may be due to the reduced synthesis of precursor proteins and the sterility of their guts. Human milk contains 1\u20134 \u03bcg/L of vitamin K1, while formula-derived milk can contain up to 100 \u03bcg/L in supplemented formulas. Vitamin K2 concentrations in human milk appear to be much lower than those of vitamin K1. Occurrence of vitamin K deficiency bleeding in the first week of the infant's life is estimated at 0.25\u20131.7%, with a prevalence of 2\u201310 cases per 100,000 births.[72] Premature babies have even lower levels of the vitamin, so they are at a higher risk from this deficiency.",

Without vitamin K, blood coagulation is seriously impaired, and uncontrolled bleeding occurs. Low levels of vitamin K also weaken bones and promote calcification of arteries and other soft tissues[citation needed].\nChemically, the vitamin K family comprises 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (3-) derivatives. Vitamin K includes two natural vitamers: vitamin K1 and vitamin K2.[1] Vitamin K2, in turn, consists of a number of related chemical subtypes, with differing lengths of carbon side chains made of isoprenoid groups of atoms.\nVitamin K1, also known as phylloquinone, is made by plants, and is found in highest amounts in green leafy vegetables because it is directly involved in photosynthesis. It may be thought of as the plant form of vitamin K. It is active as a vitamin in animals and performs the classic functions of vitamin K, including its activity in the production of blood-clotting proteins. Animals may also convert it to vitamin K2.",
                "The National Academy of Medicine (NAM) updated an estimate of what constitutes an adequate intake (AI) for vitamin K in 2001. The NAM does not distinguish between K1 and K2 \u2013 both are counted as vitamin K. At that time there was not sufficient evidence to set the more rigorous estimated average requirement (EAR) or recommended dietary allowance (RDA) given for most of the essential vitamins and minerals. The current daily AIs for vitamin K for adult women and men are 90 \u03bcg and 120 \u03bcg respectively. The AI for pregnancy and lactation is 90 \u03bcg. For infants up to 12 months the AI is 2\u20132.5 \u03bcg, and for children aged 1 to 18 years the AI increases with age from 30 to 75 \u03bcg. As for safety, the FNB also sets tolerable upper intake levels (known as ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of vitamin K no UL is set, as evidence for adverse effects is not sufficient. Collectively EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as dietary reference intakes.[43] The European Food Safety Authority reviewed the same safety question and did not set an UL.[44]\nFor U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percentage of daily value (%DV). For vitamin K labeling purposes the daily value was 80 \u03bcg, but as of May 2016 it has been revised upwards to 120 \u03bcg. A table of the pre-change adult daily values is provided at reference daily intake. Food and supplement companies have until 28 July 2018 to comply with the change.\nSee also: Vitamin K2 \u00a7 Dietary sources\nK1 (\u03bcg)[45]\nKale, cooked\nCollards, cooked\nCollards, raw\nSwiss chard, cooked\nSwiss chard, raw\nTurnip greens, raw\nRomaine lettuce, raw\nTable from \"Important information to know when you are taking: Warfarin (Coumadin) and Vitamin K\", Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health Drug Nutrient Interaction Task Force.[46]",

                "Bacteria in the gut flora can also convert K1 into vitamin K2. In addition, bacteria typically lengthen the isoprenoid side chain of vitamin K2 to produce a range of vitamin K2 forms, most notably the MK-7 to MK-11 homologues of vitamin K2. All forms of K2 other than MK-4 can only be produced by bacteria, which use these forms in anaerobic respiration. The MK-7 and other bacterially derived forms of vitamin K2 exhibit vitamin K activity in animals, but MK-7's extra utility over MK-4, if any, is unclear and is a matter of investigation.\nThree synthetic types of vitamin K are known: vitamins K3, K4, and K5. Although the natural K1 and all K2 homologues and synthetic K4 and K5 have proven nontoxic, the synthetic form K3 (menadione) has shown toxicity.[2]\n1.2 Cardiovascular health\n1.4 Coumarin poisoning\n4.1 Conversion of vitamin K1 to vitamin K2\n4.2 Vitamin K2\n6 Absorption and dietary need\n7 Dietary reference intake\n10 Biochemistry\n10.1 Function in animals\n10.2 Gamma-carboxyglutamate proteins\n10.3 Methods of assessment\n10.4 Function in bacteria\n11 Injection in newborns\n11.3 Controversy\nA review of 2014 concluded that there is positive evidence that monotherapy using MK-4, one of the forms of Vitamin K2, reduces fracture incidence in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis, and suggested further research on the combined use of MK-4 with bisphosphonates. In contrast, an earlier review article of 2013 concluded that there is no good evidence that vitamin K supplementation helps prevent osteoporosis or fractures in postmenopausal women.[3]\nA Cochrane systematic review of 2006 suggested that supplementation with Vitamin K1 and with MK4 reduces bone loss; in particular, a strong effect of MK-4 on incident fractures among Japanese patients was emphasized.[4]\nA review article of 2016 suggested to consider, as one of several measures for bone health, increasing the intake of foods rich in vitamins K1 and K2.[5]\nCardiovascular health[edit]",
                "Bleeding in infants due to vitamin K deficiency can be severe, leading to hospitalization, blood transfusions, brain damage, and death. Supplementation can prevent most cases of vitamin K deficiency bleeding in the newborn. Intramuscular administration is more effective in preventing late vitamin K deficiency bleeding than oral administration.[73][74]\nAs a result of the occurrences of vitamin K deficiency bleeding, the Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended 0.5\u20131 mg of vitamin K1 be administered to all newborns shortly after birth.[74]\nIn the UK vitamin K supplementation is recommended for all newborns within the first 24 hours.[75] This is usually given as a single intramuscular injection of 1 mg shortly after birth but as a second-line option can be given by three oral doses over the first month.[76]\nControversy arose in the early 1990s regarding this practice, when two studies suggested a relationship between parenteral administration of vitamin K and childhood cancer,[77] however, poor methods and small sample sizes led to the discrediting of these studies, and a review of the evidence published in 2000 by Ross and Davies found no link between the two.[78] Doctors reported emerging concerns in 2013,[79] after treating children for serious bleeding problems. They cited lack-of newborn vitamin K administration, as the reason that the problems occurred, and recommended that breastfed babies could have an increased risk unless they receive a preventative dose.",
                "Osteoporosis[51][52] and coronary heart disease[53][54] are strongly associated with lower levels of K2 (menaquinone). Vitamin K2 (as menaquinones MK-4 through MK-10) intake level is inversely related to severe aortic calcification and all-cause mortality.[8]\nFunction in animals[edit]\nMechanism of action of vitamin K1.\nThe function of vitamin K2 in the animal cell is to add a carboxylic acid functional group to a glutamate (Glu) amino acid residue in a protein, to form a gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residue. This is a somewhat uncommon posttranslational modification of the protein, which is then known as a \"Gla protein\". The presence of two \u2212COOH (carboxylic acid) groups on the same carbon in the gamma-carboxyglutamate residue allows it to chelate calcium ions. The binding of calcium ions in this way very often triggers the function or binding of Gla-protein enzymes, such as the so-called vitamin K-dependent clotting factors discussed below.\nWithin the cell, vitamin K undergoes electron reduction to a reduced form called vitamin K hydroquinone, catalyzed by the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR).[55] Another enzyme then oxidizes vitamin K hydroquinone to allow carboxylation of Glu to Gla; this enzyme is called gamma-glutamyl carboxylase[56][57] or the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase. The carboxylation reaction only proceeds if the carboxylase enzyme is able to oxidize vitamin K hydroquinone to vitamin K epoxide at the same time. The carboxylation and epoxidation reactions are said to be coupled. Vitamin K epoxide is then reconverted to vitamin K by VKOR. The reduction and subsequent reoxidation of vitamin K coupled with carboxylation of Glu is called the vitamin K cycle.[58] Humans are rarely deficient in vitamin K1 because, in part, vitamin K1 is continuously recycled in cells.[59]",
                "Phylloquinone (K1)[15][16] or menaquinone (K2) are capable of reversing the anticoagulant activity of the anticoagulant warfarin (tradename Coumadin). Warfarin works by blocking recycling of vitamin K, so that the body and tissues have lower levels of active vitamin K, and thus a deficiency of vitamin K.\nSupplemental vitamin K (for which oral dosing is often more active than injectable dosing in human adults) reverses the vitamin K deficiency caused by warfarin, and therefore reduces the intended anticoagulant action of warfarin and related drugs.[17] Sometimes small amounts of vitamin K are given orally to patients taking warfarin so that the action of the drug is more predictable.[17] The proper anticoagulant action of the drug is a function of vitamin K intake and drug dose, and due to differing absorption must be individualized for each patient.[citation needed] The action of warfarin and vitamin K both require two to five days after dosing to have maximum effect, and neither warfarin or vitamin K shows much effect in the first 24 hours after they are given.[18]\nThe newer anticoagulants dabigatran and rivaroxaban have different mechanisms of action that do not interact with vitamin K, and may be taken with supplemental vitamin K.[19][20]\nVitamin K2 (menaquinone). In menaquinone, the side chain is composed of a varying number of isoprenoid residues. The most common number of these residues is four, since animal enzymes normally produce menaquinone-4 from plant phylloquinone.\nA sample of phytomenadione for injection, also called phylloquinone\nThe three synthetic forms of vitamin K are vitamins K3 (menadione), K4, and K5, which are used in many areas, including the pet food industry (vitamin K3) and to inhibit fungal growth (vitamin K5).[21]\nConversion of vitamin K1 to vitamin K2[edit]\nVitamin K1 (phylloquinone) \u2013 both forms of the vitamin contain a functional naphthoquinone ring and an aliphatic side chain. Phylloquinone has a phytyl side chain.",
                "Vitamin K1 is found chiefly in leafy green vegetables such as dandelion greens (which contain 778.4 \u03bcg per 100 g, or 741% of the recommended daily amount), spinach, swiss chard, lettuce and Brassica vegetables (such as cabbage, kale, cauliflower, broccoli, and brussels sprouts) and often the absorption is greater when accompanied by fats such as butter or oils; some fruits, such as avocados, kiwifruit and grapes, are also high in vitamin K. By way of reference, two tablespoons of parsley contains 153% of the recommended daily amount of vitamin K.[47] Some vegetable oils, notably soybean oil, contain vitamin K, but at levels that would require relatively large calorie consumption to meet the USDA-recommended levels.[48] colonic bacteria synthesize a significant portion of humans' vitamin K needs; newborns often receive a vitamin K shot at birth to tide them over until their colons become colonized at five to seven days of age from the consumption of breast milk.\nThe tight binding of vitamin K1 to thylakoid membranes in chloroplasts makes it less bioavailable. For example, cooked spinach has a 5% bioavailability of phylloquinone, however, fat added to it increases bioavailability to 13% due to the increased solubility of vitamin K in fat.[49]\nMain article: Vitamin K deficiency\nAverage diets are usually not lacking in vitamin K, and primary deficiency is rare in healthy adults. Newborn infants are at an increased risk of deficiency. Other populations with an increased prevalence of vitamin K deficiency include those who suffer from liver damage or disease (e.g. alcoholics), cystic fibrosis, or inflammatory bowel diseases, or have recently had abdominal surgeries. Secondary vitamin K deficiency can occur in people with bulimia, those on stringent diets, and those taking anticoagulants. Other drugs associated with vitamin K deficiency include salicylates, barbiturates, and cefamandole, although the mechanisms are still unknown. Vitamin K1 deficiency can result in coagulopathy, a bleeding disorder.[50]Symptoms of K1 deficiency include anemia, bruising, nosebleeds and bleeding of the gums in both sexes, and heavy menstrual bleeding in women.",

                "In the early 1930s, Danish scientist Henrik Dam investigated the role of cholesterol by feeding chickens a cholesterol-depleted diet.[80] He initially replicated experiments reported by scientists at the Ontario Agricultural College (OAC).[81] McFarlane, Graham and Richardson, working on the chick feed program at OAC, had used chloroform to remove all fat from chick chow. They noticed that chicks fed only fat-depleted chow developed hemorrhages and started bleeding from tag sites.[82] Dam found that these defects could not be restored by adding purified cholesterol to the diet. It appeared that \u2013 together with the cholesterol \u2013 a second compound had been extracted from the food, and this compound was called the coagulation vitamin. The new vitamin received the letter K because the initial discoveries were reported in a German journal, in which it was designated as Koagulationsvitamin. Edward Adelbert Doisy of Saint Louis University did much of the research that led to the discovery of the structure and chemical nature of vitamin K.[83] Dam and Doisy shared the 1943 Nobel Prize for medicine for their work on vitamin K (K1 and K2) published in 1939. Several laboratories synthesized the compound(s) in 1939.[84]\nFor several decades, the vitamin K-deficient chick model was the only method of quantifying vitamin K in various foods: the chicks were made vitamin K-deficient and subsequently fed with known amounts of vitamin K-containing food. The extent to which blood coagulation was restored by the diet was taken as a measure for its vitamin K content. Three groups of physicians independently found this: Biochemical Institute, University of Copenhagen (Dam and Johannes Glavind), University of Iowa Department of Pathology (Emory Warner, Kenneth Brinkhous, and Harry Pratt Smith), and the Mayo Clinic (Hugh Butt, Albert Snell, and Arnold Osterberg).[85]\nThe first published report of successful treatment with vitamin K of life-threatening hemorrhage in a jaundiced patient with prothrombin deficiency was made in 1938 by Smith, Warner, and Brinkhous.[86]",
                "Another interesting class of invertebrate Gla-containing proteins is synthesized by the fish-hunting snail Conus geographus.[61] These snails produce a venom containing hundreds of neuroactive peptides, or conotoxins, which is sufficiently toxic to kill an adult human. Several of the conotoxins contain two to five Gla residues.[62]\nMethods of assessment[edit]\nVitamin K status can be assessed by:\nThe prothrombin time (PT) test measures the time required for blood to clot. A blood sample is mixed with citric acid and put in a fibrometer; delayed clot formation indicates a deficiency. This test is insensitive to mild deficiency, as the values do not change until the concentration of prothrombin in the blood has declined by at least 50%.[63]\nUndercarboxylated prothrombin (PIVKA-II); in a study of 53 newborns, found \"PT (prothrombin time) is a less sensitive marker than PIVKA II\",[64] and as indicated above, PT is unable to detect subclinical deficiencies that can be detected with PIVKA-II testing.\nPlasma phylloquinone was found to be positively correlated with phylloquinone intake in elderly British women, but not men,[65] but an article by Schurgers et al. reported no correlation between FFQ[further explanation needed] and plasma phylloquinone.[66]\nUrinary \u03b3-carboxyglutamic acid responds to changes in dietary vitamin K intake. Several days are required before any change can be observed. In a study by Booth et al., increases of phylloquinone intakes from 100 \u03bcg to between 377 and 417 \u03bcg for five days did not induce a significant change. Response may be age-specific.[67]\nUndercarboxylated osteocalcin (UcOc) levels have been inversely correlated with stores of vitamin K[68] and bone strength in developing rat tibiae. Another study following 78 post-menopausal Korean women found a supplement regimen of vitamins K and D, and calcium, but not a regimen of vitamin D and calcium, was inversely correlated with reduced UcOc levels.[69]\nFunction in bacteria[edit]",

                "The MK-4 form of vitamin K2 is produced by conversion of vitamin K1 in the testes, pancreas, and arterial walls.[22] While major questions still surround the biochemical pathway for this transformation, the conversion is not dependent on gut bacteria, as it occurs in germ-free rats[23][24] and in parenterally-administered K1 in rats.[25][26] In fact, tissues that accumulate high amounts of MK-4 have a remarkable capacity to convert up to 90% of the available K1 into MK-4.[27][28] There is evidence that the conversion proceeds by removal of the phytyl tail of K1 to produce menadione as an intermediate, which is then condensed with an activated geranylgeranyl moiety (see also prenylation) to produce vitamin K2 in the MK-4 (menatetrione) form.[29]\nVitamin K2[edit]\nMain article: Vitamin K2\nVitamin K2 (menaquinone) includes several subtypes. The two subtypes most studied are menaquinone-4 (menatetrenone, MK-4) and menaquinone-7 (MK-7).\nVitamin K1, the precursor of most vitamin K in nature, is a stereoisomer of phylloquinone, an important chemical in green plants, where it functions as an electron acceptor in photosystem I during photosynthesis. For this reason, vitamin K1 is found in large quantities in the photosynthetic tissues of plants (green leaves, and dark green leafy vegetables such as romaine lettuce, kale and spinach), but it occurs in far smaller quantities in other plant tissues (roots, fruits, etc.). Iceberg lettuce contains relatively little. The function of phylloquinone in plants appears to have no resemblance to its later metabolic and biochemical function (as \"vitamin K\") in animals, where it performs a completely different biochemical reaction.\nVitamin K (in animals) is involved in the carboxylation of certain glutamate residues in proteins to form gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues. The modified residues are often (but not always) situated within specific protein domains called Gla domains. Gla residues are usually involved in binding calcium, and are essential for the biological activity of all known Gla proteins.[30]",

                "Vitamin K2, specifically menaquinones (MK-4 through MK-10), is crucial for preventing osteoporosis, coronary heart disease, severe aortic calcification, and all-cause mortality. Its primary function in animals is to carboxylate glutamate residues in proteins, forming gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues that can bind calcium ions, often triggering the function of Gla-protein enzymes. This process involves vitamin K being reduced to vitamin K hydroquinone by VKOR, then oxidized by gamma-glutamyl carboxylase to enable carboxylation, forming the vitamin K cycle. Vitamin K1 deficiency is rare due to its recycling within cells.",
                "Phylloquinone (K1) and menaquinone (K2) can reverse the anticoagulant effects of warfarin by replenishing vitamin K levels, which warfarin depletes. Oral vitamin K supplementation is more effective than injectable forms in adults and can make warfarin's action more predictable. The newer anticoagulants dabigatran and rivaroxaban do not interact with vitamin K. Vitamin K2 (menaquinone) has a side chain of varying isoprenoid residues, typically four, and is produced by animal enzymes from plant phylloquinone.

This discovery was made by studying cows treated with a vitamin K antagonist, warfarin, which produced a prothrombin variant with Glu instead of Gla. Over the past three decades, the biochemical process of vitamin K converting Glu to Gla has been extensively studied globally.",

                        "Vitamin K is a group of fat-soluble vitamins essential for the synthesis of proteins involved in blood coagulation, calcium binding in bones and tissues, and vascular biology. It includes two natural vitamers: vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) produced by plants, and vitamin K2 (menaquinone), which consists of several subtypes with varying carbon side chains. Vitamin K1 is abundant in green leafy vegetables and plays a key role in photosynthesis, while both forms are crucial for blood clotting and bone health.\n\nBacteria in the gut flora can convert vitamin K1 into vitamin K2, with various forms of K2 produced, such as MK-7 to MK-11. Synthetic forms of vitamin K, including K3, K4, and K5, exist, but K3 is toxic and banned by the FDA. Vitamin K2, particularly MK-4, has been studied for its potential to reduce fracture incidence in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis, though the evidence is mixed.\n\nVitamin K intake is linked to inhibiting arterial calcification and stiffening, but there is limited evidence supporting its use for primary cardiovascular disease prevention. A study found a correlation between high menaquinone intake and reduced cardiovascular disease and mortality in older adults. Vitamin K supplements are not supported by medical evidence for slowing tumor growth.\n\nPhylloquinone (K1) and menaquinone (K2) can reverse the anticoagulant effects of warfarin by replenishing vitamin K levels, which warfarin depletes. Oral vitamin K supplementation is more effective than injectable forms in adults and can make warfarin's action more predictable. The newer anticoagulants dabigatran and rivaroxaban do not interact with vitamin K.\n\nThe MK-4 form of vitamin K2 is produced through the conversion of vitamin K1 in various tissues, including the testes, pancreas, and arterial walls. This conversion does not rely on gut bacteria and can occur in germ-free rats and through parenteral administration of K1.\n\nSeventeen human proteins with Gla domains have been identified, playing roles in blood coagulation, bone metabolism, and vascular biology. Vitamin K is essential for the function of these proteins and is stored in fatty tissue. Dietary deficiency of vitamin K is rare unless the small intestine is damaged or broad-spectrum antibiotics are used, which can reduce gut production of vitamin K by 74%. Chronic kidney disease and the elderly are also at risk for vitamin K deficiency.\n\nThe National Academy of Medicine (NAM) updated the adequate intake (AI) for vitamin K in 2001, setting AIs for adult women and men at 90 \u03bcg and 120 \u03bcg respectively, with no distinction between K1 and K2. No tolerable upper intake level (UL) has been set for vitamin K due to insufficient evidence of adverse effects.\n\nVitamin K1 is primarily found in leafy green vegetables and its absorption is enhanced with fats. Colonic bacteria synthesize a significant portion of human vitamin K needs, and newborns often receive a vitamin K shot at birth. Vitamin K deficiency is rare in healthy adults but can occur in newborns, those with liver disease, cystic fibrosis, or inflammatory bowel diseases, and individuals on anticoagulants or strict diets. Deficiency symptoms include coagulopathy, anemia, bruising, and excessive bleeding.",

Its primary function involves the carboxylation of glutamate residues in proteins to form gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues, which bind calcium ions and activate Gla-protein enzymes. This process is essential for the proper functioning of proteins involved in blood coagulation, bone metabolism, and cardiovascular health.\n\nVitamin K1 deficiency is rare due to its recycling within cells, but deficiencies can lead to severe bleeding, particularly in newborns who lack gut bacteria to synthesize vitamin K2. Supplementation with vitamin K1 is recommended for all newborns to prevent life-threatening bleeding, a practice supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the UK's guidelines.\n\nWarfarin and related compounds inhibit the vitamin K cycle by blocking VKOR, leading to reduced carboxylation of clotting factors and potential clotting disorders. Monitoring is crucial to avoid overdose and ensure proper clotting function.\n\nResearch has shown that adequate vitamin K intake, particularly K2, is associated with reduced risks of osteoporosis, coronary heart disease, and arterial calcification.

                "Current causes several observable effects, which historically were the means of recognising its presence. That water could be decomposed by the current from a voltaic pile was discovered by Nicholson and Carlisle in 1800, a process now known as electrolysis. Their work was greatly expanded upon by Michael Faraday in 1833. Current through a resistance causes localised heating, an effect James Prescott Joule studied mathematically in 1840.:23\u201324 One of the most important discoveries relating to current was made accidentally by Hans Christian \u00d8rsted in 1820, when, while preparing a lecture, he witnessed the current in a wire disturbing the needle of a magnetic compass. He had discovered electromagnetism, a fundamental interaction between electricity and magnetics. The level of electromagnetic emissions generated by electric arcing is high enough to produce electromagnetic interference, which can be detrimental to the workings of adjacent equipment.\nIn engineering or household applications, current is often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative.:11 If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this takes the form of a sine wave.:206\u201307 Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance.:223\u201325 These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.",
                "Long before any knowledge of electricity existed, people were aware of shocks from electric fish. Ancient Egyptian texts dating from 2750 BCE referred to these fish as the \"Thunderer of the Nile\", and described them as the \"protectors\" of all other fish. Electric fish were again reported millennia later by ancient Greek, Roman and Arabic naturalists and physicians. Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients suffering from ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them. Possibly the earliest and nearest approach to the discovery of the identity of lightning, and electricity from any other source, is to be attributed to the Arabs, who before the 15th century had the Arabic word for lightning ra\u2018ad (\u0631\u0639\u062f) applied to the electric ray.\nAncient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing. Thales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature.\nBenjamin Franklin conducted extensive research on electricity in the 18th century, as documented by Joseph Priestley (1767) History and Present Status of Electricity, with whom Franklin carried on extended correspondence.",
                "The concept of the electric field was introduced by Michael Faraday. An electric field is created by a charged body in the space that surrounds it, and results in a force exerted on any other charges placed within the field. The electric field acts between two charges in a similar manner to the way that the gravitational field acts between two masses, and like it, extends towards infinity and shows an inverse square relationship with distance. However, there is an important difference. Gravity always acts in attraction, drawing two masses together, while the electric field can result in either attraction or repulsion. Since large bodies such as planets generally carry no net charge, the electric field at a distance is usually zero. Thus gravity is the dominant force at distance in the universe, despite being much weaker.\nA hollow conducting body carries all its charge on its outer surface. The field is therefore zero at all places inside the body.:88 This is the operating principal of the Faraday cage, a conducting metal shell which isolates its interior from outside electrical effects.\nThe principles of electrostatics are important when designing items of high-voltage equipment. There is a finite limit to the electric field strength that may be withstood by any medium. Beyond this point, electrical breakdown occurs and an electric arc causes flashover between the charged parts. Air, for example, tends to arc across small gaps at electric field strengths which exceed 30 kV per centimetre. Over larger gaps, its breakdown strength is weaker, perhaps 1 kV per centimetre. The most visible natural occurrence of this is lightning, caused when charge becomes separated in the clouds by rising columns of air, and raises the electric field in the air to greater than it can withstand. The voltage of a large lightning cloud may be as high as 100 MV and have discharge energies as great as 250 kWh.\nA pair of AA cells. The + sign indicates the polarity of the potential difference between the battery terminals.",
                "Electricity generation is often done with electric generators, but can also be supplied by chemical sources such as electric batteries or by other means from a wide variety of sources of energy. Electric power is generally supplied to businesses and homes by the electric power industry. Electricity is usually sold by the kilowatt hour (3.6 MJ) which is the product of power in kilowatts multiplied by running time in hours. Electric utilities measure power using electricity meters, which keep a running total of the electric energy delivered to a customer. Unlike fossil fuels, electricity is a low entropy form of energy and can be converted into motion or many other forms of energy with high efficiency.\nElectronics deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes, optoelectronics, sensors and integrated circuits, and associated passive interconnection technologies. The nonlinear behaviour of active components and their ability to control electron flows makes amplification of weak signals possible and electronics is widely used in information processing, telecommunications, and signal processing. The ability of electronic devices to act as switches makes digital information processing possible. Interconnection technologies such as circuit boards, electronics packaging technology, and other varied forms of communication infrastructure complete circuit functionality and transform the mixed components into a regular working system.\nToday, most electronic devices use semiconductor components to perform electron control. The study of semiconductor devices and related technology is considered a branch of solid state physics, whereas the design and construction of electronic circuits to solve practical problems come under electronics engineering.\nThus, the work of many researchers enabled the use of electronics to convert signals into high frequency oscillating currents, and via suitably shaped conductors, electricity permits the transmission and reception of these signals via radio waves over very long distances.\nEarly 20th-century alternator made in Budapest, Hungary, in the power generating hall of a hydroelectric station (photograph by Prokudin-Gorsky, 1905\u20131915).",
                "Some organisms, such as sharks, are able to detect and respond to changes in electric fields, an ability known as electroreception, while others, termed electrogenic, are able to generate voltages themselves to serve as a predatory or defensive weapon. The order Gymnotiformes, of which the best known example is the electric eel, detect or stun their prey via high voltages generated from modified muscle cells called electrocytes. All animals transmit information along their cell membranes with voltage pulses called action potentials, whose functions include communication by the nervous system between neurons and muscles. An electric shock stimulates this system, and causes muscles to contract. Action potentials are also responsible for coordinating activities in certain plants.\nIn the 19th and early 20th century, electricity was not part of the everyday life of many people, even in the industrialised Western world. The popular culture of the time accordingly often depicted it as a mysterious, quasi-magical force that can slay the living, revive the dead or otherwise bend the laws of nature. This attitude began with the 1771 experiments of Luigi Galvani in which the legs of dead frogs were shown to twitch on application of animal electricity. \"Revitalization\" or resuscitation of apparently dead or drowned persons was reported in the medical literature shortly after Galvani's work. These results were known to Mary Shelley when she authored Frankenstein (1819), although she does not name the method of revitalization of the monster. The revitalization of monsters with electricity later became a stock theme in horror films.\nAs the public familiarity with electricity as the lifeblood of the Second Industrial Revolution grew, its wielders were more often cast in a positive light, such as the workers who \"finger death at their gloves' end as they piece and repiece the living wires\" in Rudyard Kipling's 1907 poem Sons of Martha. Electrically powered vehicles of every sort featured large in adventure stories such as those of Jules Verne and the Tom Swift books. The masters of electricity, whether fictional or real\u2014including scientists such as Thomas Edison, Charles Steinmetz or Nikola Tesla\u2014were popularly conceived of as having wizard-like powers.",
                "Electricity is a very convenient way to transfer energy, and it has been adapted to a huge, and growing, number of uses. The invention of a practical incandescent light bulb in the 1870s led to lighting becoming one of the first publicly available applications of electrical power. Although electrification brought with it its own dangers, replacing the naked flames of gas lighting greatly reduced fire hazards within homes and factories. Public utilities were set up in many cities targeting the burgeoning market for electrical lighting. In the late 20th century and in modern times, the trend has started to flow in the direction of deregulation in the electrical power sector.\nThe resistive Joule heating effect employed in filament light bulbs also sees more direct use in electric heating. While this is versatile and controllable, it can be seen as wasteful, since most electrical generation has already required the production of heat at a power station. A number of countries, such as Denmark, have issued legislation restricting or banning the use of resistive electric heating in new buildings. Electricity is however still a highly practical energy source for heating and refrigeration, with air conditioning/heat pumps representing a growing sector for electricity demand for heating and cooling, the effects of which electricity utilities are increasingly obliged to accommodate.\nElectricity is used within telecommunications, and indeed the electrical telegraph, demonstrated commercially in 1837 by Cooke and Wheatstone, was one of its earliest applications. With the construction of first intercontinental, and then transatlantic, telegraph systems in the 1860s, electricity had enabled communications in minutes across the globe. Optical fibre and satellite communication have taken a share of the market for communications systems, but electricity can be expected to remain an essential part of the process.\nThe effects of electromagnetism are most visibly employed in the electric motor, which provides a clean and efficient means of motive power. A stationary motor such as a winch is easily provided with a supply of power, but a motor that moves with its application, such as an electric vehicle, is obliged to either carry along a power source such as a battery, or to collect current from a sliding contact such as a pantograph. Electrically powered vehicles are used in public transportation, such as electric buses and trains, and an increasing number of battery-powered electric cars in private ownership.",
                "With electricity ceasing to be a novelty and becoming a necessity of everyday life in the later half of the 20th century, it required particular attention by popular culture only when it stops flowing, an event that usually signals disaster. The people who keep it flowing, such as the nameless hero of Jimmy Webb\u2019s song \"Wichita Lineman\" (1968), are still often cast as heroic, wizard-like figures.\nAmp\u00e8re's circuital law, connects the direction of an electric current and its associated magnetic currents.\n^ Diogenes Laertius.

                "Electricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist William Gilbert wrote De Magnete, in which he made a careful study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber. He coined the New Latin word electricus (\"of amber\" or \"like amber\", from \u1f24\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, elektron, the Greek word for \"amber\") to refer to the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed. This association gave rise to the English words \"electric\" and \"electricity\", which made their first appearance in print in Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica of 1646.\nFurther work was conducted in the 17th and early 18th centuries by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. Later in the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key to the bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges.\nIn 1791, Luigi Galvani published his discovery of bioelectromagnetics, demonstrating that electricity was the medium by which neurons passed signals to the muscles. Alessandro Volta's battery, or voltaic pile, of 1800, made from alternating layers of zinc and copper, provided scientists with a more reliable source of electrical energy than the electrostatic machines previously used. The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian \u00d8rsted and Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re in 1819\u20131820. Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821, and Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827. Electricity and magnetism (and light) were definitively linked by James Clerk Maxwell, in particular in his \"On Physical Lines of Force\" in 1861 and 1862.",
                "The presence of charge gives rise to an electrostatic force: charges exert a force on each other, an effect that was known, though not understood, in antiquity.:457 A lightweight ball suspended from a string can be charged by touching it with a glass rod that has itself been charged by rubbing with a cloth. If a similar ball is charged by the same glass rod, it is found to repel the first: the charge acts to force the two balls apart. Two balls that are charged with a rubbed amber rod also repel each other. However, if one ball is charged by the glass rod, and the other by an amber rod, the two balls are found to attract each other. These phenomena were investigated in the late eighteenth century by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, who deduced that charge manifests itself in two opposing forms. This discovery led to the well-known axiom: like-charged objects repel and opposite-charged objects attract.\nThe force acts on the charged particles themselves, hence charge has a tendency to spread itself as evenly as possible over a conducting surface. The magnitude of the electromagnetic force, whether attractive or repulsive, is given by Coulomb's law, which relates the force to the product of the charges and has an inverse-square relation to the distance between them.:35 The electromagnetic force is very strong, second only in strength to the strong interaction, but unlike that force it operates over all distances. In comparison with the much weaker gravitational force, the electromagnetic force pushing two electrons apart is 1042 times that of the gravitational attraction pulling them together.\nStudy has shown that the origin of charge is from certain types of subatomic particles which have the property of electric charge. Electric charge gives rise to and interacts with the electromagnetic force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature. The most familiar carriers of electrical charge are the electron and proton. Experiment has shown charge to be a conserved quantity, that is, the net charge within an electrically isolated system will always remain constant regardless of any changes taking place within that system. Within the system, charge may be transferred between bodies, either by direct contact, or by passing along a conducting material, such as a wire.:2\u20135 The informal term static electricity refers to the net presence (or 'imbalance') of charge on a body, usually caused when dissimilar materials are rubbed together, transferring charge from one to the other.",
                "\u00d8rsted's discovery in 1821 that a magnetic field existed around all sides of a wire carrying an electric current indicated that there was a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism. Moreover, the interaction seemed different from gravitational and electrostatic forces, the two forces of nature then known. The force on the compass needle did not direct it to or away from the current-carrying wire, but acted at right angles to it. \u00d8rsted's slightly obscure words were that \"the electric conflict acts in a revolving manner.\" The force also depended on the direction of the current, for if the flow was reversed, then the force did too.\n\u00d8rsted did not fully understand his discovery, but he observed the effect was reciprocal: a current exerts a force on a magnet, and a magnetic field exerts a force on a current. The phenomenon was further investigated by Amp\u00e8re, who discovered that two parallel current-carrying wires exerted a force upon each other: two wires conducting currents in the same direction are attracted to each other, while wires containing currents in opposite directions are forced apart. The interaction is mediated by the magnetic field each current produces and forms the basis for the international definition of the ampere.\nThis relationship between magnetic fields and currents is extremely important, for it led to Michael Faraday's invention of the electric motor in 1821. Faraday's homopolar motor consisted of a permanent magnet sitting in a pool of mercury. A current was allowed through a wire suspended from a pivot above the magnet and dipped into the mercury. The magnet exerted a tangential force on the wire, making it circle around the magnet for as long as the current was maintained.",
                "The concept of electric potential is closely linked to that of the electric field. A small charge placed within an electric field experiences a force, and to have brought that charge to that point against the force requires work. The electric potential at any point is defined as the energy required to bring a unit test charge from an infinite distance slowly to that point. It is usually measured in volts, and one volt is the potential for which one joule of work must be expended to bring a charge of one coulomb from infinity.:494\u201398 This definition of potential, while formal, has little practical application, and a more useful concept is that of electric potential difference, and is the energy required to move a unit charge between two specified points. An electric field has the special property that it is conservative, which means that the path taken by the test charge is irrelevant: all paths between two specified points expend the same energy, and thus a unique value for potential difference may be stated.:494\u201398 The volt is so strongly identified as the unit of choice for measurement and description of electric potential difference that the term voltage sees greater everyday usage.\nFor practical purposes, it is useful to define a common reference point to which potentials may be expressed and compared. While this could be at infinity, a much more useful reference is the Earth itself, which is assumed to be at the same potential everywhere. This reference point naturally takes the name earth or ground. Earth is assumed to be an infinite source of equal amounts of positive and negative charge, and is therefore electrically uncharged\u2014and unchargeable.\nElectric potential is a scalar quantity, that is, it has only magnitude and not direction. It may be viewed as analogous to height: just as a released object will fall through a difference in heights caused by a gravitational field, so a charge will 'fall' across the voltage caused by an electric field. As relief maps show contour lines marking points of equal height, a set of lines marking points of equal potential (known as equipotentials) may be drawn around an electrostatically charged object. The equipotentials cross all lines of force at right angles. They must also lie parallel to a conductor's surface, otherwise this would produce a force that will move the charge carriers to even the potential of the surface.",

                "Experimentation by Faraday in 1831 revealed that a wire moving perpendicular to a magnetic field developed a potential difference between its ends. Further analysis of this process, known as electromagnetic induction, enabled him to state the principle, now known as Faraday's law of induction, that the potential difference induced in a closed circuit is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux through the loop. Exploitation of this discovery enabled him to invent the first electrical generator in 1831, in which he converted the mechanical energy of a rotating copper disc to electrical energy. Faraday's disc was inefficient and of no use as a practical generator, but it showed the possibility of generating electric power using magnetism, a possibility that would be taken up by those that followed on from his work.\nItalian physicist Alessandro Volta showing his \"battery\" to French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte in the early 19th century.\nThe ability of chemical reactions to produce electricity, and conversely the ability of electricity to drive chemical reactions has a wide array of uses.\nElectrochemistry has always been an important part of electricity. From the initial invention of the Voltaic pile, electrochemical cells have evolved into the many different types of batteries, electroplating and electrolysis cells. Aluminium is produced in vast quantities this way, and many portable devices are electrically powered using rechargeable cells.\nA basic electric circuit. The voltage source V on the left drives a current I around the circuit, delivering electrical energy into the resistor R. From the resistor, the current returns to the source, completing the circuit.\nAn electric circuit is an interconnection of electric components such that electric charge is made to flow along a closed path (a circuit), usually to perform some useful task.\nElectric power is the rate at which electric energy is transferred by an electric circuit. The SI unit of power is the watt, one joule per second.",
                "While the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering. Through such people as Alexander Graham Bell, Ott\u00f3 Bl\u00e1thy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, \u00c1nyos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, electricity turned from a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life.\nIn 1887, Heinrich Hertz:843\u201344 discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily. In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets, energising electrons. This discovery led to the quantum revolution. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for \"his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". The photoelectric effect is also employed in photocells such as can be found in solar panels and this is frequently used to make electricity commercially.\nThe first solid-state device was the \"cat's-whisker detector\" first used in the 1900s in radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a germanium crystal) to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect. In a solid-state component, the current is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it. Current flow can be understood in two forms: as negatively charged electrons, and as positively charged electron deficiencies called holes. These charges and holes are understood in terms of quantum physics. The building material is most often a crystalline semiconductor.\nThe solid-state device came into its own with the invention of the transistor in 1947. Common solid-state devices include transistors, microprocessor chips, and RAM. A specialized type of RAM called flash RAM is used in USB flash drives and more recently, solid-state drives to replace mechanically rotating magnetic disc hard disk drives. Solid state devices became prevalent in the 1950s and the 1960s, during the transition from vacuum tubes to semiconductor diodes, transistors, integrated circuit (IC) and the light-emitting diode (LED).",
                "In the 6th century BC, the Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus experimented with amber rods and these experiments were the first studies into the production of electrical energy. While this method, now known as the triboelectric effect, can lift light objects and generate sparks, it is extremely inefficient. It was not until the invention of the voltaic pile in the eighteenth century that a viable source of electricity became available. The voltaic pile, and its modern descendant, the electrical battery, store energy chemically and make it available on demand in the form of electrical energy. The battery is a versatile and very common power source which is ideally suited to many applications, but its energy storage is finite, and once discharged it must be disposed of or recharged. For large electrical demands electrical energy must be generated and transmitted continuously over conductive transmission lines.\nElectrical power is usually generated by electro-mechanical generators driven by steam produced from fossil fuel combustion, or the heat released from nuclear reactions; or from other sources such as kinetic energy extracted from wind or flowing water. The modern steam turbine invented by Sir Charles Parsons in 1884 today generates about 80 percent of the electric power in the world using a variety of heat sources. Such generators bear no resemblance to Faraday's homopolar disc generator of 1831, but they still rely on his electromagnetic principle that a conductor linking a changing magnetic field induces a potential difference across its ends. The invention in the late nineteenth century of the transformer meant that electrical power could be transmitted more efficiently at a higher voltage but lower current. Efficient electrical transmission meant in turn that electricity could be generated at centralised power stations, where it benefited from economies of scale, and then be despatched relatively long distances to where it was needed.\nSince electrical energy cannot easily be stored in quantities large enough to meet demands on a national scale, at all times exactly as much must be produced as is required. This requires electricity utilities to make careful predictions of their electrical loads, and maintain constant co-ordination with their power stations. A certain amount of generation must always be held in reserve to cushion an electrical grid against inevitable disturbances and losses.",
                "The charge on electrons and protons is opposite in sign, hence an amount of charge may be expressed as being either negative or positive. By convention, the charge carried by electrons is deemed negative, and that by protons positive, a custom that originated with the work of Benjamin Franklin. The amount of charge is usually given the symbol Q and expressed in coulombs; each electron carries the same charge of approximately \u22121.6022\u00d710\u221219 coulomb. The proton has a charge that is equal and opposite, and thus +1.6022\u00d710\u221219 coulomb. Charge is possessed not just by matter, but also by antimatter, each antiparticle bearing an equal and opposite charge to its corresponding particle.\nThe movement of electric charge is known as an electric current, the intensity of which is usually measured in amperes. Current can consist of any moving charged particles; most commonly these are electrons, but any charge in motion constitutes a current. Electric current can flow through some things, electrical conductors, but will not flow through an electrical insulator.\nBy historical convention, a positive current is defined as having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called conventional current. The motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit, one of the most familiar forms of current, is thus deemed positive in the opposite direction to that of the electrons. However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction, or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation.\nThe process by which electric current passes through a material is termed electrical conduction, and its nature varies with that of the charged particles and the material through which they are travelling. Examples of electric currents include metallic conduction, where electrons flow through a conductor such as metal, and electrolysis, where ions (charged atoms) flow through liquids, or through plasmas such as electrical sparks. While the particles themselves can move quite slowly, sometimes with an average drift velocity only fractions of a millimetre per second,:17 the electric field that drives them itself propagates at close to the speed of light, enabling electrical signals to pass rapidly along wires.",

In early days, electricity was considered as being not related to magnetism. Later on, many experimental results and the development of Maxwell's equations indicated that both electricity and magnetism are from a single phenomenon: electromagnetism. Various common phenomena are related to electricity, including lightning, static electricity, electric heating, electric discharges and many others.\nThe presence of an electric charge, which can be either positive or negative, produces an electric field. The movement of electric charges is an electric current and produces a magnetic field.\nWhen a charge is placed in a location with a non-zero electric field, a force will act on it. The magnitude of this force is given by Coulomb's law. Thus, if that charge were to move, the electric field would be doing work on the electric charge. Thus we can speak of electric potential at a certain point in space, which is equal to the work done by an external agent in carrying a unit of positive charge from an arbitrarily chosen reference point to that point without any acceleration and is typically measured in volts.\nelectronics which deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes and integrated circuits, and associated passive interconnection technologies.\nElectrical phenomena have been studied since antiquity, though progress in theoretical understanding remained slow until the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

The rapid expansion in electrical technology at this time transformed industry and society, becoming a driving force for the Second Industrial Revolution.

A modern integrated circuit may contain several billion miniaturised transistors in a region only a few centimetres square.\nA voltage applied to a human body causes an electric current through the tissues, and although the relationship is non-linear, the greater the voltage, the greater the current. The threshold for perception varies with the supply frequency and with the path of the current, but is about 0.1 mA to 1 mA for mains-frequency electricity, though a current as low as a microamp can be detected as an electrovibration effect under certain conditions. If the current is sufficiently high, it will cause muscle contraction, fibrillation of the heart, and tissue burns. The lack of any visible sign that a conductor is electrified makes electricity a particular hazard. The pain caused by an electric shock can be intense, leading electricity at times to be employed as a method of torture. Death caused by an electric shock is referred to as electrocution. Electrocution is still the means of judicial execution in some jurisdictions, though its use has become rarer in recent times.\nElectricity is not a human invention, and may be observed in several forms in nature, a prominent manifestation of which is lightning. Many interactions familiar at the macroscopic level, such as touch, friction or chemical bonding, are due to interactions between electric fields on the atomic scale. The Earth's magnetic field is thought to arise from a natural dynamo of circulating currents in the planet's core. Certain crystals, such as quartz, or even sugar, generate a potential difference across their faces when subjected to external pressure. This phenomenon is known as piezoelectricity, from the Greek piezein (\u03c0\u03b9\u03ad\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd), meaning to press, and was discovered in 1880 by Pierre and Jacques Curie.

                        "Electricity is a set of physical phenomena related to electric charge and its motion, which includes lightning, static electricity, and electric heating. Historically, electricity and magnetism were considered separate, but they are now understood to be aspects of electromagnetism. An electric charge creates an electric field, and its movement generates a magnetic field. When a charge is placed in an electric field, it experiences a force described by Coulomb's law. The concept of electric potential, measured in volts, represents the work required to move a unit of positive charge to a specific point in space. Electronics, which involves active electrical components like transistors and integrated circuits, is a key application of electricity. Electrical phenomena have been studied since antiquity, but significant theoretical and practical advancements occurred in the 17th and 18th centuries, leading to widespread industrial and residential use by the late 19th century. Electricity's versatility has driven technological advancements and is integral to modern society.",
                        "Long before electricity was understood, people experienced shocks from electric fish, as documented in ancient Egyptian texts from 2750 BCE. These fish were known for their numbing effects, and were even used to treat ailments. Ancient Mediterranean cultures observed static electricity, with Thales of Miletus incorrectly attributing it to magnetism. The Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, though this is uncertain. Benjamin Franklin later conducted extensive research on electricity in the 18th century.",
                        "Electricity remained an intellectual curiosity until the 1600s when William Gilbert studied electricity and magnetism, coining the term \"electricus.\" Further research in the 17th and 18th centuries by figures like Benjamin Franklin led to discoveries about the electrical nature of lightning and the Leyden jar. Luigi Galvani's work in bioelectromagnetics and Alessandro Volta's invention of the voltaic pile provided new insights. The unity of electric and magnetic phenomena was recognized by Hans Christian \u00d8rsted and Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re, while Michael Faraday and Georg Ohm made significant advancements in electric motors and circuit analysis. James Clerk Maxwell definitively linked electricity, magnetism, and light in the 1860s.",
                        "The late 19th century marked significant advancements in electrical engineering, transforming electricity from a scientific curiosity into a vital tool for modern life. Key figures like Alexander Graham Bell, Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla, and others played crucial roles in this transformation. Heinrich Hertz's discovery in 1887 that ultraviolet light enhances electric sparks led to Albert Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect in 1905, which contributed to the quantum revolution and is now utilized in solar panels. The first solid-state device, the \"cat's-whisker detector,\" emerged in the 1900s, paving the way for transistors and other solid-state components that dominate modern electronics. The invention of the transistor in 1947 was a pivotal moment, leading to the development of microprocessor chips, RAM, and flash RAM, which are integral to devices like USB drives and solid-state drives. The transition from vacuum tubes to solid-state devices in the 1950s and 1960s revolutionized electronics, making them more efficient and compact.",
                        "The presence of charge leads to electrostatic force, where charges exert forces on each other. This was observed in antiquity but understood later. Charged objects can repel or attract each other based on their charges. Charles-Augustin de Coulomb investigated these phenomena and deduced that charge exists in two opposing forms, leading to the axiom: like-charged objects repel, and opposite-charged objects attract. The electromagnetic force, governed by Coulomb's law, is strong and operates over all distances, being 10^42 times stronger than gravitational force between two electrons. Charge originates from subatomic particles like electrons and protons, and it is a conserved quantity in isolated systems. Static electricity refers to the imbalance of charge on a body, often resulting from the transfer of charge between dissimilar materials.",
                        "The charge on electrons is negative, while protons carry a positive charge, both quantities being equal in magnitude. This convention originated from Benjamin Franklin. Charge is symbolized as Q and measured in coulombs, with electrons carrying approximately \u22121.6022\u00d710\u221219 coulombs and protons +1.6022\u00d710\u221219 coulombs. Charge is also present in antimatter, with antiparticles having opposite charges to their corresponding particles.\n\nElectric current, the flow of electric charge, is measured in amperes and can involve any moving charged particles, typically electrons. Current can flow through conductors but not insulators. By convention, a positive current flows from the positive to the negative part of a circuit, opposite to the direction of electron flow. This is known as conventional current.\n\nElectrical conduction describes how current passes through materials, varying based on the charged particles and the material. Examples include metallic conduction (electrons in metals) and electrolysis (ions in liquids or plasmas). Despite particles moving slowly, the electric field that drives them propagates near the speed of light, allowing rapid transmission of electrical signals.",
                        "Current, the flow of electric charge, has several observable effects, including electrolysis, heating, and electromagnetism. It can be described as direct current (DC), which flows in one direction, or alternating current (AC), which periodically reverses direction. AC is characterized by a sine wave pattern and delivers energy in alternating directions, influenced by properties like inductance and capacitance, especially during transients."

                        "The electric field, introduced by Michael Faraday, is generated by charged bodies and exerts force on other charges within the field. It operates similarly to gravity but can cause attraction or repulsion. Conducting bodies, like those in a Faraday cage, distribute charge on their outer surfaces, creating a zero field inside. Electrostatics principles are crucial for high-voltage equipment design, as exceeding certain electric field strengths can lead to electrical breakdown and arcs, such as in lightning, which can reach up to 100 MV and discharge energies of 250 kWh.",
                        "Electric potential is a measure of the energy required to bring a unit charge from infinity to a specific point within an electric field. It is typically measured in volts, with one volt representing the energy needed to move one coulomb of charge. The concept of electric potential difference is more practical, as it quantifies the energy required to move a unit charge between two points. Electric fields are conservative, meaning the energy expended is path-independent, allowing for a unique potential difference between any two points. The Earth is commonly used as a reference point for potential, referred to as \"earth\" or \"ground,\" assuming it is at the same potential everywhere. Electric potential is a scalar quantity, meaning it has magnitude but no direction, and can be visualized similarly to height in a gravitational field. Equipotential lines, which mark points of equal potential, are drawn perpendicular to electric field lines and parallel to conductor surfaces to maintain equilibrium.",
                        "In 1821, \u00d8rsted discovered that a magnetic field surrounds a wire carrying an electric current, indicating a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism. This interaction differed from known forces like gravity and electrostatics, as the force on a compass needle acted perpendicular to the current-carrying wire and depended on the current's direction. \u00d8rsted observed reciprocal effects: currents affect magnets, and magnetic fields affect currents. Amp\u00e8re further explored this, finding that parallel currents attract if flowing in the same direction and repel if opposite. This interaction, mediated by magnetic fields, underpins the definition of the ampere. The discovery led to Faraday's invention of the electric motor in 1821, which used a magnet and mercury to create circular motion in a wire with current.",
                        "In 1831, Michael Faraday's experiments demonstrated that moving a wire perpendicular to a magnetic field induces a potential difference, leading to the discovery of electromagnetic induction. This principle, known as Faraday's law of induction, states that the induced potential difference in a closed circuit is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux through the loop. Faraday's invention of the first electrical generator in 1831, using a rotating copper disc, showcased the potential to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy through magnetism. Although inefficient, this early generator paved the way for future developments in electric power generation.\n\nElectrochemistry, starting with Volta's invention of the Voltaic pile, has evolved to include various types of batteries, electroplating, and electrolysis cells, with applications ranging from producing aluminum to powering portable devices. An electric circuit is an interconnected system where electric charge flows in a closed path, enabling the transfer of electric energy to perform tasks. Electric power, measured in watts (joules per second), is the rate at which this energy is transferred within a circuit.",
                        "Electricity generation can be achieved through electric generators, batteries, or various energy sources, and is typically supplied by the electric power industry. It is measured in kilowatt hours and monitored by electricity meters. Unlike fossil fuels, electricity has low entropy and can be converted into other forms of energy efficiently. Electronics involves electrical circuits with active components like transistors and diodes, enabling signal amplification and digital information processing. Most modern electronics rely on semiconductor components, studied under solid state physics, while circuit design and construction fall under electronics engineering. This technology allows for the transmission and reception of signals via radio waves over long distances.",
                        "In the 6th century BC, Thales of Miletus began studying electrical energy through amber rods, leading to the discovery of the triboelectric effect. However, it wasn't until the 18th century with the invention of the voltaic pile that a practical source of electricity emerged. The battery, a modern descendant of the voltaic pile, stores energy chemically and is widely used, though it has finite capacity and must be recharged or replaced. For large-scale electrical demands, continuous generation and transmission via conductive lines are necessary. Electrical power is typically generated by steam-driven electro-mechanical generators, often using fossil fuels, nuclear reactions, or renewable sources like wind and water. The steam turbine, invented by Sir Charles Parsons in 1884, currently accounts for about 80% of global electricity production. Transformers, invented later in the 19th century, enabled more efficient high-voltage, low-current transmission, allowing centralized power stations to supply electricity over long distances. Since large-scale electrical storage is impractical, utilities must precisely match generation with demand, requiring careful load prediction and coordination with power stations to maintain grid stability.",
                        "Electricity is a versatile and convenient energy source with a growing number of applications. Its use in lighting, introduced in the 1870s, significantly reduced fire hazards compared to gas lighting. Public utilities were established to meet the demand for electrical lighting, and while some countries have restricted resistive electric heating in new buildings due to its inefficiency, electricity remains practical for heating, refrigeration, and air conditioning. Telecommunications, starting with the electrical telegraph in 1837, have relied on electricity for global communication, a role it continues to play alongside optical fibre and satellite systems. Electric motors provide clean and efficient motive power, used in various applications from stationary winches to electric vehicles in public and private transportation."

                        "Electronic devices rely on transistors, a crucial 20th-century invention, which are essential components of modern circuitry. Transistors are highly miniaturized, with billions fitting into a few square centimeters on an integrated circuit. Voltage applied to the human body generates electric current, with higher voltages producing greater currents. Perception thresholds vary, but typically range from 0.1 mA to 1 mA for mains-frequency electricity. High currents can cause muscle contractions, heart fibrillation, and tissue burns, making electricity hazardous due to its invisible nature. Electric shocks can be intensely painful and are sometimes used as a method of torture, with death by electric shock termed electrocution. Electrocution remains a judicial execution method in some places.\n\nElectricity occurs naturally in various forms, such as lightning, and is fundamental to atomic-scale interactions like touch and friction. Earth's magnetic field is believed to result from circulating currents in its core. Piezoelectricity, discovered by the Curies in 1880, describes the generation of voltage in crystals like quartz under pressure. This effect is reciprocal, causing dimensional changes in response to electric fields. Bioelectrogenesis in microbial life, particularly in soils and sediments, involves anaerobic respiration, mimicked by microbial fuel cells.",
                        "Some organisms, like sharks and electric eels, have unique abilities related to electricity. Sharks can sense electric fields (electroreception), while electric eels generate high voltages to stun prey using specialized cells called electrocytes. All animals use voltage pulses, or action potentials, to transmit information and coordinate activities, including muscle contractions. In the past, electricity was seen as mysterious and magical, with early experiments showing it could make dead frogs' legs twitch. This perception influenced literature and film, with electricity often used to revive or create monsters. As electricity became more common, it was portrayed more positively, with inventors like Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla seen as having almost magical powers.",

The individuals responsible for maintaining electricity, like the \"Wichita Lineman,\" are often portrayed as heroic figures. Amp\u00e8re's circuital law links electric currents to their associated magnetic effects. Historical references, such as those by Aristotle and Diogenes Laertius, suggest that Thales believed in a soul or life force within inanimate objects, including the magnet. The Enlightenment period saw significant advancements in understanding electricity, with figures like Benjamin Franklin contributing to its study, though the authenticity of some experiments attributed to him is uncertain.",

The concept of electric charge is foundational in solid-state physics and microelectronic circuit design, as highlighted in works by John Blakemore and Richard Jaeger. Coulomb's law, formulated by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, states that the repulsive force between two charged spheres is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The term 'electricity' was historically referred to as 'quantity of electricity' (Q), and the development of electromagnetic theory was influenced by figures like Faraday and Einstein. Practical applications include EMI reduction techniques and the understanding of electric fields, particularly in conductors. Oliver Heaviside and the deregulation of energy markets are also mentioned in relation to the evolution of electrical engineering and its impact on modern society.",

Is it a matter of money? Scale?Probably a mix of a lot of things. One big thing was during this recession, Intel was the ONLY fab company that didn't scale back their R&D. That alone gave Intel a large advantage.Intel has almost always been ahead. One of the reasons could be that Intel works with much higher margins than many of the commodity companies like Samsung and TSMC.Outside of the P4 flop and some of the monopolistic abuses, Intel has typically been selling to high end customers that are willing to pay a premium for \"the best\".Intel has a large benefit of having a relatively \"good name\" when it comes to CPUs, so they can effectively charge a brand-name premium.I'm sure there are other reasons, and probably better reasons, but these are the main ones that I think of.",
                "Intel had better decide that they are competing in this space \"for real\", or they are screwed. They've already let the Atom languish for five years, during which ARM has completely caught up in performance.Just like Tim Cook said, if you don't cannibalize your own markets someone else will do it for you.Whether Intel will embrace that concept in time remains to be seen. Personally, I hope they don't; if Intel transforms into a chipless Fab company (like TSMC) everyone benefits.\nI still think Samsung has the advantage long term because they have both the SOC and the memory products. As mentioned in the article, TSV's (Through Silicon Via's) are going to be quite a disruption. Today, people normally stack an LPDDR2 package on top of their SOC package (POP or Package On Package). Within the LPDDR2 package, you could have a stack of DRAM die typically with wire bonding connecting the die within the package.Once you more to TSV's, you can have a LOT more connections between the SOC and its DRAM's. While this is being standardized through JEDEC (http://www.jedec.org/category/technolog ... a/3d-ics-0), Samsung has all the pieces in house to do whatever they want. You could see a 512 bit or higher bus from the SOC to the memory. The trick is that the memory and the SOC need to line up with each other when you stack them. This gives Samsung an inherent advantage.This isn't just going to impact mobile either. Take a look at that JEDEC link. It also lists High Bandwidth Memory (HBM). This is a 1024 bit bus that provides 128GBytes/s to 256GBytes/s of bandwidth to a stack of up to 8 DRAM's. Here is your processor that includes 8-16 cores and 4GBytes of really, really, fast DRAM... No DIMMs required. How many of them do you want in your server rack?If I was Intel or Apple, I would be thinking seriously about making some investments in Micron to guarantee they make some compelling DRAM's to integrate with their SOC's and processors... otherwise Samsung is going to blow them out of the water on bandwidth.",

Scale?Money and momentum, the x86 market is a huge money maker for Intel so it is able to recoup its huge investments for advanced foundries.Exactly and I would clarify that it's all about margins, the difference between what it costs to make a chip and what it sells for. The margins for desktop and server processors is huge because a) the whole product is expensive so $200 to $1000 for the chip is acceptable, and b) Intel has huge advantages in that space and little competition.So Intel can afford to do the R&D to stay ahead of the curve and keep their position. When your smartphone chip sells for $25 you can't do the R&D to leapfrog a company that sells Xeons for $1000 and Core i5's for $200.Spot on.Intel are able to piggyback other development efforts off the highly lucrative mainstream x86 market which generates the huge sums of money to fund their amazing fab technology.The question for the future is how the economics will stack up when overall device costs fall significantly and there is a big downward pressure on SoC prices. In that situation, can Intel still justify bringing their A-game to a market where products are essentially commoditised and you have processors selling for a only a few dollars each?The lesson from their previous involvement in the DRAM market is that they probably won't want to be involved because there isn't enough money to be made to justify manufacturing phone SoCs on a cutting edge, or near cutting edge process. In that scenario, Intel may not totally abandon the market but they might just stick to manufacturing SoCs on nodes that are a step or two behind the state of the art.",

Right now Apple wants you to own an iPhone AND iPad AND Macbook AND iWatch AND Apple TV. Microsoft, OTOH, is making the Surface so that you could ditch your laptop and just use a Surface. Not everyone, but some people.If 5 years from now, we're in a world where a significant number of people use a Surface-type device instead of a laptop, then the PC market is going to contract significantly.

The real advantage is one of flexibility; as costs drop and the market expands, it will be increasingly necessary for vendors like HTC to offer a wide range of phones based on radically different SoCs. You don't mention in the article that each SoC necessarily requires a bit of parallel dev work unlike the PC. In the PC world there is a standard BIOS and HW architecture that allows for pluggable designs. On a highly integrated SoC this is untrue. HTC suffers because it has to support radically different SoCs, their drivers and boot loaders, etc. Quote:While a vertically integrated company like Apple can focus and maintain leadership in a specific (and highly lucrative) niche, it would be very difficult to expand in many growing areas of the market. The differences between an iPhone 6 and a $20 feature phone are tremendous and would be very difficult for a single company to bridge.It's only difficult because Apple chooses to ignore that market, not because they can't. If they can release a $99 Apple TV, they can surely cobble together a $20 feature phone if they chose to eschew 8GB of NAND, BT, WiFi, a specialized dock connector, LTE, and their specialized processors. In other words, build the equivalent of an iPod shuffle with a horrible screen and no OS to speak of.",

The real advantage is one of flexibility; as costs drop and the market expands, it will be increasingly necessary for vendors like HTC to offer a wide range of phones based on radically different SoCs.

The differences between an iPhone 6 and a $20 feature phone are tremendous and would be very difficult for a single company to bridge.\nHowever, SoC vendors will attempt to reap the benefits of vertical integration by providing complete reference platforms to OEMs. Conceptually, this is a form of \"optional\" system integration, where the phone vendor or carrier can get the entire platform from the SoC supplier. This has the principal advantages of reducing time to market while also providing a baseline quality and experience for consumers. Currently, this approach has mostly been tested in emerging markets, but it's likely to become more common over time. There is a crucial distinction between reference platforms and vertical integration. Namely, OEMs can always choose to customize a platform to differentiate, and the SoC vendor avoids dealing with consumers directly. Typically, most of the customization is in terms of software on top of a base operating system.\nQuote:Moreover, that will make the transition to a 10nm node even more difficult, as the foundries will have to move from 20nm interconnects to 10nm interconnects and skip a generation.The advances in technology lately allowing components on such a small scale to even be envisioned, much less planned for, are truly amazing.\nOff topic: show\nI present the first generation 'non-technical' rock:",

                "Looking forward, these distinctions will likely become more pronounced. Many tablets today use high-end smartphone SoCs, but the difference in power targets and expected performance is quite large. As the markets grow in volume, SoCs will inevitably bifurcate to focus on one market or the other. Even today, Apple is doing so, with the A6 for phones and the larger A6X for tablets. Other vendors may need to wait a few years to have the requisite volume, but eventually the two markets will be clearly separate.\nHorizontal business model evolution\nAnother aspect of the mobile device market that is currently in flux and likely to change in the coming years is the business model for the chip and system vendors. Currently, Apple is the only company truly pursuing a vertically integrated model, where all phones and tablets are based on Apple\u2019s own SoC designs and iOS. The tight integration between hardware and software has been a huge boon for Apple, and it has yielded superb products.\nSamsung is one of the few others companies that takes a vertically integrated approach to phones and tablets, although in truth its strategy seems to be ambivalent on that point. Unlike Apple, Samsung\u2019s SoCs are readily available to third parties, and some Samsung devices, such as the S7562 Galaxy S Duos, use SoCs from competitors. More recently though, there has been a trend of Samsung devices using Samsung SoCs, at least for the premier products. For the moment, Samsung\u2019s approach is best characterized as a hybrid, particularly as the company lacks a bespoke OS.\nThe rest of the major SoC vendors (e.g., Intel, Qualcomm, Nvidia, TI, Mediatek, etc.) have stayed pretty far away from actual mobile devices.

                "While phones and tablets are mobile devices that often share a great deal of software, it's becoming increasingly clear the two are very different products. These two markets have started to diverge and will continue doing so over time.\nFrom a technical perspective, smartphones are far more compact and power constrained. Smartphone SoCs are limited to around 1W, both by batteries and by thermal dissipation. The raison d\u2019etre of a smartphone is connectivity, so a cellular modem is an absolute necessity. For the cost sensitive-models that make up the vast majority of the market, the modem is integrated into the SoC itself. High-end designs favor discrete modems with a greater power budget instead. The main smartphone OSes today are iOS and Android, though Windows is beginning to make an appearance (perhaps with Linux or BlackBerry on the horizon). Just as importantly, phone vendors like HTC must pass government certification and win the approval of carriers. There is very much a walled-garden aspect, where carriers control which devices can be attached to their networks, and in some cases devices can only be sold through a certain carrier. The business model places consumers quite far removed from the actual hardware.\nIn contrast, tablets are far more akin to the PC both technically and economically. The power budget for tablet SoCs is much greater, up to 4W for a passively cooled device and as high as 7-8W for systems with fans. This alone means there is a much wider range of tablet designs than smartphones. Moreover, the default connectivity for tablets is Wi-Fi rather than a cellular modem. The vast majority of tablets do not have cellular modems, and even fewer customers actually purchase a wireless data plan. As a result, cellular modems are almost always optional discrete components of the platform. The software ecosystem is relatively similar, with Microsoft, Apple, and Google OSes available. Because tablets eschew cellular modems, the time to market is faster, and they are much more commonly sold directly to consumers rather than through carriers. In terms of usage models, tablets are much more PC-like, with reasonable-sized screens that make games and media more attractive.",

ICs are not as big a part of mobile computers as they are of desktops, even of laptops: screens, batteries, radios are a huge part of tablets' and phones' costs, as opposed to the bare SoC + RAM.2- The tablet vs phone dichotomy. For some reason (probably price insensitivity due to subsidies), Phones have a tendency to be more powerful than Tablets, ie phone SoCs are more than good enough for tablets. Since the OS and peripherals are the same, it makes more sense to design and build just one type of SoC, and just disable the phone-modem part of it (even the other radios are still required: BT, Wifi, GPS...), same as Intel disable cache and cores for their entry-level CPUs. Once you're fabbing a SoC, it makes more sense to make more of the same than to setup a separate run of a cut-down SoC on an older process, unless volumes are huge. We might still be getting previous-generation, well amortized SoCs in cheaper tablets, though.3- On the contrary, I see a tablet and phone convergence (the ugly phablet). I'm patiently waiting for the new 6\"+ phones to replace my Nook Color and Galaxy Note 1 with a single device.4- The advantage of diversity ? Software is becoming ever more important than hardware. Multiplying SoCs means multiplying product development costs, making support and updates more difficult... Again, unless volumes are huge, OEMs are probaly better off going the way of the car industry and using modular \"platforms\" housed in different chassis with various screen sizes, keyboards, radios, digitizers...I'm wondering why the \"single device\" trend does not figure in your analysis.

                "The future of mobile CPUs, part 1: Today\u2019s fork in the road | Ars Technica\n2013 may be a big year for the evolution of smartphones and tablets.\nMobile computing's rise from niche market to the mainstream is among the most significant technological trends in our lifetimes. And to a large extent, it's been driven by the bounty of Moore\u2019s Law\u2014the rule that transistor density doubles every 24 months. Initially, most mobile devices relied on highly specialized hardware to meet stringent power and size budgets. But with so many transistors available, devices inevitably grew general-purpose capabilities. Most likely, that wasn't even the real motivation. The initial desire was probably to reduce costs by creating a more flexible software ecosystem with better re-use and faster time to market. As such, the first smartphones were very much a novelty, and it took many years before the world realized the potential of such devices. Apple played a major role by creating innovative smartphones that consumers craved and quickly adopted.\nTo some extent, this is where we still stand today. Smartphones are still (relatively) expensive and primarily interesting to the developed world. But over the next 10 years, this too will change. As Moore\u2019s Law rolls on, the cost of a low-end smartphone will decline. At some point, the incremental cost will be quite minimal and many feature phones of today will be supplanted by smartphones. A $650 unsubsidized phone is well beyond the reach of most of the world compared to a $20 feature phone, but a $30 to $40 smartphone would naturally be very popular.\nIn this grand progression, 2013 will certainly be a significant milestone for mobile devices, smartphones and beyond. It's likely to be the first year in which tablets out-ship notebooks in the US. And in the coming years, this will lead to a confluence of high-end tablets and ultra-mobile notebooks as the world figures out how these devices co-exist, blend, hybridize, and/or merge.\nAgainst this backdrop, in this two-part series, we'll explore the major trends and evolution for mobile SoCs. More importantly, we'll look to where the major vendors are likely going in the next several years.\nTablet and phone divergence",
                "You're way off on the Moore's Law/cost of smartphones point. The processors used in today's high-end smartphones are already cheap, around $25. And there are less expensive options if you want a lower end product. In fact, the hardware in the whole smartphone is relatively cheap. Analyst's estimate the Z10's materials cost around $160, the iPhone 5 around $140. They're using expensive glass and metals, then there's the battery, memory, etc. which means the processor is a small factor of the cost.And then there's the jump from $140 in materials to the unsubsidized costs. The reason these phones cost $650 is because of the high margins these companies are able to get and the high cost of hardware design and/or software development. But the point is that making the processors 4 times better/cheaper isn't going to change the economics of the smartphone. What will change the economics is commoditized designs and software and cheaper materials all around. Then you'll have a $50 smartphone that's decent.\nLast edited by ggeezz on Wed Feb 13, 2013 9:17 am\nbigterp wrote:SoC?

The author suggests that Intel should embrace the idea of self-cannibalization to stay competitive, and speculates that if Intel becomes a chipless Fab company like TSMC, it could benefit everyone except Intel itself. The Atom's competitiveness with ARM chips is noted, but the author believes that Intel's shift to a tick-tock schedule will change the game, potentially even attracting Apple to use Intel chips for iOS devices.

Mabsark argues that the tablet market may take longer to saturate, possibly around 5 years. The conversation then shifts to the potential impact of devices like Microsoft's Surface, which could replace laptops, leading to a significant contraction in the PC market. This could result in some devices using moderately expensive Intel chips, while others opt for cheaper alternatives."

Intel and Apple should consider investing in Micron to secure competitive DRAM or risk being outperformed by Samsung in terms of bandwidth.\n\n7. **Future Market Saturation and Impact on Intel**:\n   - The phone/tablet market is expected to eventually saturate, similar to the desktop/laptop market. Devices like Microsoft's Surface could replace laptops, leading to a significant contraction in the PC market. This could result in some devices using moderately expensive Intel chips, while others opt for cheaper alternatives."

                "The final, consolidated summary of the main themes is as follows:\n\n1. **Intel's Competitive Advantage**:\n   - Intel maintains a strong position in the semiconductor industry, particularly in the x86 market, with high margins on desktop and server processors. Its control over advanced production processes (e.g., 14nm technology) and brand reputation enable sustained R&D efforts and premium pricing.\n\n2. **Challenges for Foundries**:\n   - Foundries producing smartphone chips face difficulties in matching Intel's R&D capabilities and closing the process gap due to lower margins. Intel's advanced processes and capabilities make it challenging for foundries to compete.\n\n3. **Trend Towards Vertical Integration**:\n   - The tech industry is increasingly moving towards vertical integration, with companies like Samsung, Apple, Intel, Amazon, and Google expanding into hardware. This trend is unlikely to reverse, as companies often specialize and rarely revert to more horizontal models.\n\n4. **Historical Context of Mobile Technology Innovation**:\n   - True innovation in mobile technology was driven by pioneers like Motorola, Nokia, Ericsson, TI, and Qualcomm over a decade ago. Modern phone manufacturers primarily use off-the-shelf System on Chips (SoCs) provided by SoC manufacturers, with the core engineering largely independent of consumer-focused companies like Apple and Samsung.\n\n5. **Intel's Involvement in the SoC Market**:\n   - Intel faces challenges in the phone/tablet market due to declining desktop/laptop sales and the rising popularity of mobile devices. Intel may focus on manufacturing SoCs on slightly older process nodes, leveraging their process design advantage for performance and efficiency.\n\n6. **Horizontal Integration and Business Models**:\n   - Horizontal integration is crucial in industries like NAND flash and displays, emphasizing extensive collaboration among various companies. Vertically integrated companies like Apple can dominate specific niches but may struggle to expand into broader market segments unless they adapt their product offerings.\n\n7. **Innovation and Market Dynamics**:\n   - Companies that developed foundational technologies like NAND flash and standardized cellular communications often failed to capitalize on their mature technologies by not innovating further. New entrants who built upon existing technology made breakthroughs in creating user-friendly interfaces and software for modern smartphones.\n\n8. **Samsung's Long-Term Advantage**:\n   - Samsung has a long-term advantage due to its integrated SOC and memory products, particularly with TSV technology, which allows for more connections between SOC and DRAM. This could lead to higher bus widths and faster memory, impacting not just mobile but also server markets.\n\n9. **Future Market Saturation and Impact on Intel**:\n   - The phone/tablet market is expected to eventually saturate, similar to the desktop/laptop market. Devices like Microsoft's Surface could replace laptops, leading to a significant contraction in the PC market. This could result in some devices using moderately expensive Intel chips, while others opt for cheaper alternatives."

                "Born declined to publicly comment on the unfolding 2008 crisis until March 2009, when she said: \"The market grew so enormously, with so little oversight and regulation, that it made the financial crisis much deeper and more pervasive than it otherwise would have been.\" She also lamented the influence of Wall Street lobbyists on the process and the refusal of regulators to discuss even modest reforms.\n\nAn October 2009 Frontline documentary titled \"The Warning\"  described Born's thwarted efforts to regulate and bring transparency to the derivatives market, and the continuing opposition thereto. The program concluded with an excerpted interview with Born sounding another warning: \"I think we will have continuing danger from these markets and that we will have repeats of the financial crisis -- may differ in details but there will be significant financial downturns and disasters attributed to this regulatory gap, over and over, until we learn from experience.\"\n\nIn 2009 Born, along with Sheila Bair of the FDIC, was awarded the John F. Kennedy Profiles in Courage Award in recognition of the \"political courage she demonstrated in sounding early warnings about conditions that contributed\" to the 2007-08 financial crisis.  According to Caroline Kennedy, \"Brooksley Born recognized that the financial security of all Americans was being put at risk by the greed, negligence and opposition of  powerful and well connected interests.... The catastrophic financial events of recent months have  proved them [Born and Sheila Bair] right.\"  One member of the President's working group had a change of heart about Brooksley Born.  SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt stated \"I've come to know her as one of the most capable, dedicated, intelligent and committed public servants that I have ever come to know\", adding that \"I could have done much better. I could have made a difference\" in response to her warnings.\n\nIn 2010, a documentary film Inside Job further alleged that derivatives regulation was ineffective from the Clinton administration on. Along with fellow whistleblower, former IMF Chief Economist Raghuram Rajan, who was also scorned by the economic establishment, Brooksley Born was cited as one of the authorities arguing that financial derivatives increase economic risk.",
                "Born and the OTC derivatives market\nBorn was appointed to the CFTC on April 15, 1994, by President Bill Clinton. Due to litigation against Bankers Trust Company by Procter and Gamble and other corporate clients, Born and her team at the CFTC sought comments on the regulation of over-the-counter derivatives, a first step in the process of writing CFTC regulations to supplement the existing regulations of the Federal Reserve System,  the Options Clearing Corporation, and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Born was particularly concerned about swaps, financial instruments that are traded over the counter between banks, insurance companies or other funds or companies, and thus have no transparency except to the two counterparties and the counterparties' regulators, if any.  CFTC regulation was strenuously opposed by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, and by Treasury Secretaries Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers. On May 7, 1998, former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt joined Rubin and Greenspan in objecting to the issuance of the CFTC's concept release. Their response dismissed Born's analysis and focused on the hypothetical possibility that CFTC regulation of swaps and other OTC derivative instruments could create a \"legal uncertainty\" regarding such financial instruments,  hypothetically reducing the value of the instruments. They argued that the imposition of regulatory costs would \"stifle financial innovation\" and encourage financial capital to transfer its  transactions offshore. The disagreement between Born and the Executive Office's top economic policy advisors has been described not only as a classic Washington turf war, but also a war of ideologies,  insofar as it is possible to argue that Born's actions were consistent with Keynesian and neoclassical economics while Greenspan, Rubin, Levitt, and Summers consistently espoused neoliberal, and neoconservative policies.",

She has five adult children - two from a previous marriage to Jacob Landau and three stepchildren.

                "In 1998, a trillion-dollar hedge fund called Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) was near collapse.  Using mathematical models to calculate debt risk, LTCM used derivatives to leverage $5 billion into more than $1 trillion, doing business with fifteen of Wall Street's largest financial institutions.  The derivative transactions were not regulated, nor were investors able to evaluate LTCM's exposures.  Born stated, \"I thought that LTCM was exactly what I had been worried about\".  In the last weekend of September 1998, the President's working group was told that the entire American economy hung in the balance.  After intervention by the Federal Reserve, the crisis was averted.  In congressional hearings into the crisis, Greenspan acknowledged that language had been introduced into an agriculture bill that would prevent CFTC from regulating the derivatives which were at the center of the crisis that threatened the US economy.  U.S. Representative Maurice Hinchey (D-NY) asked \"How many more failures do you think we'd have to have before some regulation in this area might be appropriate?\"  In response, Greenspan brushed aside the substance of Born's warnings with the simple assertion that \"the degree of supervision of regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market is quite adequate to maintain a degree of stability in the system\". Born's warning was that there wasn't any regulation of them.  Born's chief of staff, Michael Greenberger summed up Greenspan's position this way: \"Greenspan didn't believe that fraud was something that needed to be enforced, and he assumed she probably did. And of course, she did.\"  Under heavy pressure from the financial lobby, legislation prohibiting regulation of derivatives by Born's agency was passed by the Congress.  Born resigned on June 1, 1999.\n\nThe derivatives market continued to grow yearly throughout both terms of George W. Bush's administration. On September 15, 2008, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers forced a broad recognition of a financial crisis in both the US and world capital markets.  As Lehman Brothers' failure temporarily reduced financial capital's confidence, a number of newspaper articles and television programs suggested that the failure's possible causes included the conflict between the CFTC and the other regulators.Faiola, Anthony, Nakashima, Ellen and Drew, Jill. The Crash: Risk and Regulation - What Went Wrong, The Washington Post, October 15, 2008.",
                "During her long legal career, and into her retirement, Born did much pro bono and other types of volunteer work. She was active in the American Bar Association, the largest professional organization of lawyers in the United States.  Initially Born was named a member of the governing council of the ABA's Individual Rights Section, eventually becoming chairperson.  Born and Tucker founded the ABA Women's Caucus, the first organization of female lawyers in the ABA.  She held several other senior positions in the ABA, including being named the first woman member of the ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary.  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, Born provided testimony and opinion on persons nominated for federal judgeships. In 1980 she was named chair of the committee.  As chair of the committee, Born was invited to address the U.S. Congress regarding the nomination of Judge Sandra Day O'Connor to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nIn 1993, Born's name was floated as a possible candidate for Attorney General of the United States, but Janet Reno was nominated.\n\nIn July 2009, Nancy Pelosi appointed Brooksley Born as a commissioner to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC).",

During her tenure on the CFTC, Born lobbied Congress and the President to give the CFTC oversight of off-exchange markets for derivatives, in addition to its role with respect to exchange-traded derivatives, but her warnings were ignored or dismissed, and her calls for reform resisted by other regulators.<ref name=\"nytimes\">Goodman, Peter S. The Reckoning - Taking Hard New Look at a Greenspan Legacy, The New York Times, October 9, 2008.</ref> Born resigned as chairperson on June 1, 1999, shortly after Congress passed legislation prohibiting her agency from regulating derivatives.\n\nIn 2009, Born received the John F. Kennedy Profiles in Courage Award, along with Sheila Bair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, in recognition of the \"political courage she demonstrated in sounding early warnings about conditions that contributed\" to the 2007-08 financial crisis.\n\nEarly life and education\nBorn graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School (San Francisco, California) at the age of 16. She then attended Stanford University, where she majored in English and was graduated with the class of 1961.  She initially wanted to become a doctor, but a guidance counsellor at Stanford advised her against medicine, so she majored in English literature instead.\n\nShe then attended Stanford Law School, one of only seven women in her class.  She was the first female student ever to be named president of the Stanford Law Review. She received the \"Outstanding Senior\" award and graduated as valedictorian of the class of 1964.",
                "Legal career\nImmediately after law school Born was selected as a law clerk to judge Henry Edgerton of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. It was during this time that she met her first husband, Jacob C. Landau, who was a journalist covering the Federal courts at the time. Following her clerkship, she became an associate at the Washington, D.C.-based international law firm of Arnold & Porter. Born was attracted to Arnold & Porter because it was one of the few major law firms to have a woman partner at that time, Carolyn Agger, who was the head of the tax practice. Born took a two-year leave of absence from Arnold & Porter to accompany her first husband to Boston, where he had received a fellowship. During that time she worked as a research assistant to law professor Alan Dershowitz.\n\nBorn's early career at Arnold & Porter focused on international trade law, in which she represented a number of Swiss industries and the government of Switzerland. She developed a practice representing clients in numerous complex litigation and arbitration cases involving financial market transactions. Among her high-profile cases was the matter of the Hunt Brothers attempt to corner the market in silver in the 1970s. She made partner at Arnold & Porter, after moving to a three-day schedule to help raise her second child, and eventually rose to be the head of the firm's derivatives practice.\n\nBorn was among the first female attorneys to systematically address inequities regarding how the laws treated women. Born and another female lawyer, Marna Tucker, taught what is considered to have been the first \"Women and the Law\" course at Catholic University\u2019s Columbus School of Law. The class exclusively concerned prejudicial treatment of women under the laws of the United States, past and present.  Born and Tucker were surprised to discover that there was no textbook on the issue at the time.  Born is also one of the co-founders of the National Women's Law Center. Born also helped rewrite the American Bar Association rules to make it possible for more women and minorities to sit on federal bench."

This paper proposes an unsupervised method based on the information bottleneck to capture both referential complexity and task-specific utility to adequately explore sparse social communication scenarios in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).\nWe show that our model is able to i) develop a natural-language-inspired lexicon of messages that is independently composed of a set of emergent concepts, which span the observations and intents with minimal bits, ii) develop communication to align the action policies of heterogeneous agents with dissimilar feature models, and iii) learn a communication policy from watching an expert's action policy, which we term 'social shadowing'.\n\nINTRODUCTION",
                "By definition of mutual information, we have, Our network model learns \u03c0 R + (y|m) from rolled-out trajectories, R + , using our policy. The prior of our network state, \u03c0 R \u2212 (y), can be modeled from rolling out a random trajectory, R\u2212. Unfortunately, it is intractable to model \u03c0 R + (y|m) and \u03c0 R \u2212 (y) directly during iterative learning, but we can sample y + \u223c \u03c0 R + (y|m) and y \u2212 \u223c \u03c0 R \u2212 (y) directly from our network during training.\nIt has been shown that log p(y|m) provides a bound on mutual information , with the expectation over l p(m l , y l ). However, we need a tractable understanding of the information Y . In the information bottleneck, Y represents the desired outcome. In our setup, y is coordination information that helps create the desired output, such as any action a \u2212 .\nThis implies, y =\u21d2 a \u2212 . Since the transition is known, it follows that a \u2212 =\u21d2 s \u2212 f , a random future state. Thus, we have, \u03c0 This is similar to the proof for lemma A.5, but requires assumptions on messages m from the emergent language. We note that when m is random, the case defaults to lemma A.5. Thus, we assume we have at least input-oriented information in m given sufficiently satisfying equation 2. Given a sufficient emergent language, it follows that y =\u21d2 a + , where a + is an intention action based on m.\nSimilarly, since the transition is known, a + =\u21d2 s + f , a desired goal state along the trajectory. Thus, we have, \u03c0 R + (y|m) = p(s = s + f |y, m). Recall the following (as shown in ), which we have adapted to our communication objective, Proposition A.3 (rewards \u2192 probabilities). The Q-function for the goal-conditioned reward function r g (s t , m t ) = (1 \u2212 \u03b3)p(s = s g |y t ) is equivalent to the probability of state s g under the discounted state occupancy measure:",
                "We aim to satisfy the complexity objective, I(H i , M i ), through compositional communication. In order to induce complexity in our communication, we want the messages to be as non-random as possible. That is, informative with respect to the input hidden state h. In addition, we want each token within the message to share as little information as possible with the preceding tokens.\nThus, each additional token adds only informative content. Each token has a fixed length in bits W . The total sequence is limited by a fixed limit, L l W l \u2264 S, of S bits and a total of L tokens. We use a variational message generation setup, which maps the encoded hidden state h to a message m; that is, we are modeling the posterior, \u03c0 i m (m l |h).\nWe limit the vocabulary size to K tokens, e j \u2208 R D , j \u2208 [1, K] \u2282 N, where each token has dimensionality D and l \u2208 [1, L] \u2282 N. Each token m l is sampled from a categorical posterior distribution, 0 otherwise such that the message m l is mapped to the nearest neighbor e j . A set of these tokens makes a message m.\nTo satisfy the complexity objective, we want to use m i to well-represent h i and consist of independently informative m i l .\n\nIndependent Information\n\nWe derive an upper bound for the interaction information between all tokens. Proposition 4.1. For the interaction information between all tokens, the following upper bound holds: The proof is in Appendix A.1. Since we want the mutual information to be minimized in our objective, we minimize,\n\nInput-Oriented Information\n\nIn order to induce complexity in the compositional messages, we additionally want to minimize the mutual information I(H; M ) between the composed message m and the encoded information h. We derive an upper bound on the mutual information that we use as a Lagrangian term to minimize. Proposition 4.2. For the mutual information between the composed message and encoded information, the following upper bound holds:\nThe proof is in Appendix A.1. Thus, we have our Lagrangian term, Conditioning on the input or observation data is a decentralized training objective.\n\nSequence Length",
                "By using our framework to better understand the intent of others, agents can learn to communicate to align policies and coordinate. Any referential-based setup can be performed with a supervised loss, as indicated by the instant satisfaction of referential objectives. Even in the Pascal VOC game, which appears to be a purely referential objective, our results show that intelligent compression is not the only objective of referential communication.\nThe emergent communication paradigm must enable an easy-to-discriminate space for the game. In multi-agent settings, the harder challenge is to enable coordination through communication. Using contrastive communication as an optimal critic aims to satisfy this, and has shown solid improvements. Since contrastive learning benefits from good examples, this method is even more powerful when there is access to examples from expert agents.\nIn this setting, the communication may be bootstrapped, since our optimal critic has examples with strong signals from the 'social shadowing' episodes. Additionally, we show that the minimization of our independence objective enables tokens that contain minimal overlapping information with other tokens.\nPreventing trivial communication paradigms enables higher performance. Each of these objectives is complementary, so they are not trivially minimized during training, which is a substantial advantage over comparative baselines. Unlike prior work, this enables the benefits of training with reinforcement learning in multi-agent settings.\nIn addition to lower sample complexity, the mutual information regularization yields additional benefits, such as small messages, which enables the compression aspect of sparse communication. From a qualitative point of view, the independent information also yields discrete emergent concepts, which can be further made human-interpretable by a post-hoc analysis .\nThis is a step towards white-box machine learning in multi-agent settings. The interpretability of this learned white-box method could be useful in human-agent teaming as indicated by prior work . The work here will enable further results in decision-making from high-dimensional data with emergent concepts.\nThe social scenarios described are a step towards enabling a zero-shot communication policy. This work will serve as future inspiration for using emergent communication to enable ad-hoc teaming with both agents and humans.\n\nAppendix",
                "The policy network is defined by three stages: Observation Encoding, Communication, and Action Decoding. The best observation encoding and action decoding architecture is task-dependent, i.e., using multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), CNNs , GRUs , or transformer layers are best suited to different inputs.\nThe encoder transforms observation and any sequence or memory information into an encoding H. The on-policy reinforcement learning training uses RE-INFORCE or a decentralized version of MAPPO as specified by our experiments. Our work focuses on the communication stage, which can be divided into three substages: message encoding, message passing (often considered sparse communication), and message decoding.\nWe use the message passing from . For message decoding, we build on a multiheaded attention framework, which allows an agent to learn which messages are most important . Our compositional communication framework defines the message encoding, as described in section 4.\n\nObjective",
                "Social learning agents analyze cues from direct observation of other agents (novice or expert) in the same environment to learn an action policy from others. However, observing expert actions may not be sufficient to coordinate with other agents. Rather, by learning to communicate, agents can better model the intent of other agents, leading to better coordination.\nIn humans, explicit communication for coordination assumes a common communication substrate to convey abstract concepts and beliefs directly , which may not be available for new partners. To align complex beliefs, heterogeneous agents must learn a message policy that translates from one theory of mind to another to synchronize coordination.\nEspecially when there is complex information to process and share, new agent partners need to learn to communicate to work with other agents. Emergent communication studies the creation of artificial language. Often phrased as a Lewis game, speakers and listeners learn a set of tokens to communicate complex observations .\nHowever, in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), agents suffer from partial observability and non-stationarity (due to unaligned value functions) , which aims to be solved with decentralized learning through communication. In the MARL setup, agents, as speakers and listeners, learn a set of tokens to communicate observations, intentions, coordination, or other experiences which help facilitate solving tasks .\nAgents learn to communicate effectively through a backpropagation signal from their task performance . This has been found useful for applications in human-agent teaming , multirobot navigation , and coordination in complex games such as StarCraft II . Communication quality has been shown to have a strong relationship with task performance , leading to a multitude of work attempting to increase the representational capacity by decreasing the convergence rates .\nYet these methods still create degenerate communication protocols , which are uninterpretable due to joined concepts or null (lack of) information, which causes performance degradation. In this work, we investigate the challenges of learning a arXiv:2302.14276v1 LG] 28 Feb 2023 messaging lexicon to prepare emergent communication for social learning (EC4SL) scenarios.\nWe study the following hypotheses: H1) EC4SL will learn faster through structured concepts in messages leading to higher-quality solutions, H2) EC4SL aligns the policies of expert heterogeneous agents, and H3) EC4SL enables social shadowing, where an agent learns a communication policy while only observing an expert agent's action policy.",
                "In real-world tasks such as autonomous driving or robotics, humans do not necessarily learn from scratch. Rather they explore with conceptually guided information from expert mentors. In particular, having structured emergent messages reduces sample complexity, and contrastive learning can help novice agents learn from experts.\nEmergent communication can also align heterogeneous agents, a social task that has not been previously studied.",
                "We condition on inputs, especially rich information (such as pixel data), and task-specific information. When evaluating an artificial language in MARL, we are interested in referential tasks, in which communication is required to complete the task. With regard to intent-grounded communication, we study ordinal tasks, which require coordination information between agents to complete successfully.\nThus, we consider tasks with a team of agents to foster messaging that communicates coordination information that also includes their observations. To test H1, structuring emergent messages enables lower complexity, we test our methodology and analyze the input-oriented information and utility capabilities.\nNext, we analyze the ability of heterogeneous agents to understand differing communication policies (H2)). Finally, we consider the effect of social shadowing (H3), in which agents solely learn a communication policy from an expert agent's action policy. We additionally analyze the role of offline reinforcement learning for emergent communication in combination with online reinforcement learning to further learn emergent communication alongside an action policy.\nWe evaluate each scenario over 10 seeds.\n\nEnvironments",

The critic function that optimizes equation 8 is a Q-function for the goal-conditioned reward function up to a multiplicative constant 1 The critic function f (s, m, s f ) = y enc(s f ) represents the similarity between the encoding y = enc(s, m) and the encoding of the future rollout s f .\nGiven lemmas A.5 A.6 A.8 and proposition A.7, it follows that equation 8 is the NCE-binary (InfoMAX ) objective, \u00ce(M j , Y i ) = log \u03c3(f (s, m, s + f )) + log 1 \u2212 \u03c3(f (s, m, s \u2212 f )) which lower bounds the mutual information, I(M j , Y i ) \u2265 \u00ce(M j , Y i ). The critic function is unbounded, so we constrain it to [0, 1] with the sigmoid function, \u03c3( * ).\nWe suppress the reliance on h since this is directly passed through.

Since the transition is known, it follows that a \u2212 =\u21d2 s \u2212 f , a random future state.",
                "Compositional communication necessitates an adaptive limit on the total length of the sequence. Corollary 4.3. Repeat tokens, w, are redundant and can be removed. Suppose one predicts two arbitrary tokens, w k and w l . Given equation 1, it follows that there is low or near-zero mutual information between w k and w l .\nA trivial issue is that the message generator will predict every available token as to follow the unique token objective. Since the tokens are imbued with input-oriented information (equation 2), the predicted tokens will be based on relevant referential details. Thus, it follows that tokens containing irrelevant information will not be chosen.\nA nice optimization objective that follows from corollary 4.3 is that one can use self-supervised learning with an end-ofsequence (EOS) token to limit the variable total length of compositional message sequences.

The idea is to create an architecture that can generate features to enable independent message tokens. We expand each compressed token into the space of the hidden state h (1-layer linear expansion) since each token has a natural embedding in R |h| .\nThen, we perform attention using a softmin to help minimize similarity with previous tokens and sample the new token from a variational distribution. See algorithm 1 for complete details. During execution, we can generate messages directly due to equation 1, resolving any computation time lost from sequential compositional message generation.\n\nUtility through Contrastive Learning\n\nFirst, note that our Markov Network is as follows: H j \u2192 M j \u2192 Y i \u2190 H i . Continue to denote i as the agent identification and j as the agent ID such that j = i. We aim to satisfy the utility objective of the information bottleneck, I(M j ; Y i ), through contrastive learning as shown in figure 1. Proposition 5.1.\nUtility mutual information is lower bounded by the contrastive NCE-binary objective, The proof is in Appendix A.1. This result shows a need for gradient information to flow backward across agents along communication edge connections.\n\nExperiments and Results",
                "Blind Traffic Junction We consider a benchmark that requires both referential and ordinal capabilities within a team of agents. The blind traffic junction environment requires multiple agents to navigate a junction without any observation of other agents. Rather, they only observe their own state location.\nTen agents must coordinate to traverse through the lanes without colliding into agents within their lane or in the junction. Our training uses REINFORCE . Pascal VOC Game We further evaluate the complexity of compositional communication with a Pascal VOC . This is a two-agent referential game similar to the Cifar game but requires the prediction of multiple classes.\nDuring each episode, each agent observes a random image from the Pascal VOC dataset containing exactly two unique labels. Each agent must encode information given only the raw pixels from the original image such that the other agent can recognize the two class labels in the original image. An agent receives a reward of 0.25 per correctly chosen class label and will receive a total reward of 1 if both agents guess all labels correctly.\nSee figure 2. Our training uses heterogeneous agents trained with PPO (modified from MAPPO repository). For simplicity of setup, we consider images with exactly two unique labels from a closed subset of size five labels of the original set of labels from the Pascal VOC data. Furthermore, these images must be of size 375 \u00d7 500 pixels.\nThus, the resultant dataset comprised 534 unique images from the Pascal VOC dataset.\n\nBaselines",
                "To evaluate our methodology, we compare our method to the following baselines: (1) no-comm, where agents do not communicate; (2) rl-comm, which uses a baseline communication method learned solely through policy loss ; (3) ae-comm, which uses an autoencoder to ground communication in input observations ; (4) VQ-VIB, which uses a variational autoencoder to ground discrete communication in input observations and a mutual information objective to ensure low entropy communication .\nWe provide an ablation of the loss parameter \u03b2 in table 1 in the blind traffic junction scenario. When \u03b2 = 0, we use our compositional message paradigm without our derived loss terms. We find that higher complexity and independence losses increase sample complexity. When \u03b2 = 1, the model was unable to converge.\nHowever, when there is no regularization loss, the model performs worse (with no guarantees about referential representation). We attribute this to the fact that our independence criteria learns a stronger causal relationship. There are fewer spurious features that may cause an agent to take an incorrect action.\nIn order to understand the effect of the independent concept representation, we analyze the emergent language's capacity for redundancy. A message token m l is redundant if there exists another token m k that represents the same information. With our methodology, the emergent 'language' converges to the exact number of observations and intents required to solve the task.\nWith a soft discrete threshold, the independent information loss naturally converges to a discrete number of tokens in the vocabulary. Our \u03b2 ablation in table 1 yields a bijection between each token in the vocabulary and the possible emergent concepts, i.e., the enumerated observations and intents. Thus for \u03b2 = 0.1, there is no redundancy.\nSparse Communication In corollary 4.3, we assume that there is no mutual information between tokens. In practice, the loss may only be near-zero. Our empirical results yield independence loss around 1e \u2212 4. In table 1, the size of the messages is automatically compressed to the smallest size to represent the information.",
                "By learning a communication policy, the agent is encouraged to develop a more structured understanding of intent, leading to better coordination. The setting is very realistic among humans and many computer vision and RL frameworks may develop rich feature spaces for a specific solo task, but have not yet interacted with other agents, which may lead to failure without alignment.\nWe enable a compositional emergent communication paradigm, which exhibits clustering and informativeness properties. We show theoretically and through empirical results that compositional language enables independence properties among tokens with respect to referential information. Additionally, when combined with contrastive learning, our method outperforms competing methods that only ground communication on referential information.\nWe show that contrastive learning is an optimal critic for communication, reducing sample complexity for the unsupervised emergent communication objective. In addition to the more human-like format, compositional communication is able to create variable-length messages, meaning that we are not limited to sending insufficiently compressed messages with little information, increasing the quality of each communication.\nIn order to test our hypotheses, we show the utility of our method in multi-agent settings with a focus on teams of agents, high-dimensional pixel data, and expansions to heterogeneous teams of agents of varying skill levels. Social learning requires agents to explore to observe and learn from expert cues.\nWe interpolate between this form of social learning and imitation learning, which learns action policies directly from examples. We introduce a 'social shadowing' learning approach where we use first-person observations, rather than third-person observations, to encourage the novice to learn latently or conceptually how to communicate and develop an understanding of intent for better coordination.\nThe social shadowing episodes are alternated with traditional MARL during training. Contrastive learning, which works best with positive examples, is apt for social shadowing. Originally derived to enable lower complexity emergent lexicons, we find that the contrastive learning objective is apt for agents to develop internal models and relationships of the task through social shadowing.\nThe idea is to enable a shared emergent communication substrate (with minimal bandwidth) to enable future coordi-nation with novel partners. Our contributions are deriving an optimal critic for a communication policy and showing that the information bottleneck helps extend communication to social learning scenarios.",
                "The properties of the tokens in emergent communication directly affect their informative ability. As a baseline, continuous communication tokens can represent maximum information but lack human-interpretable properties. Discrete 1-hot (binary vector) tokens allow for a finite vocabulary, but each token contains the same magnitude of information, with equal orthogonal distance to each other token.\nSimilar to word embeddings in natural language, discrete prototypes are an effort to cluster similar information together from continuous vectors . Building on the continuous word embedding properties, VQ-VIB , an information-theoretic observation grounding based on VQ-VAE properties , uses variational properties to provide word embedding properties for continuous emergent tokens.\nLike discrete prototypes, they exhibit a clustering property based on similar information but are more informative. However, each of these message types determines a single token for communication. Tokens are stringed together to create emergent \"sentences\".\n\nPreliminaries\n\nWe formulate our setup as a decentralized, partially observable Markov Decision Process with communication (Dec-POMDP-Comm). Formally, our problem is defined by the tuple, S, A, M, T , R, O, \u2126, \u03b3 . We define S as the set of states, A i , i \u2208 [1, N ] as the set of actions, which includes task-specific actions, and M i as the set of communications for N agents.\nT is the transition between states due to the multi-agent joint action space T : S \u00d7 A 1 , ..., A N \u2192 S. \u2126 defines the set of observations in our partially observable setting. Partial observability requires communication to complete the tasks successfully. O i : M 1 , ..., M N \u00d7 \u015c \u2192 \u2126 maps the communications and local state, \u015c, to a distribution of observations for each agent.\nR defines the reward function and \u03b3 defines the discount factor.\n\nArchitecture",
                "In order to test the heterogeneous alignment ability of our methodology to learn higher-order concepts from highdimensional data, we analyze the performance on the Pascal VOC game. We compare our methodology against ae-comm to show that concepts should consist of independent information directly from task signal rather than compression to reconstruct inputs.\nThat is, we show an empirical result on pixel data to verify the premise of the information bottleneck. Our methodology significantly outperforms the observation-grounded ae-comm baseline, as demonstrated by figure 4. The ae-comm methodology, despite using autoencoders to learn observation-grounded communication, performs only slightly better than no-comm.\nOn the other hand, our methodology is able to outperform both baselines significantly. It is important to note that based on figure 4, our methodology is able to guess more than two of the four labels correctly across the two agents involved, while the baseline methodologies struggle to guess exactly two of thew four labels consistently.\nThis can be attributed to our framework being able to learn compositional concepts that are much more easily discriminated due to mutual independence.\n\nSocial Shadowing\n\nCritics of emergent communication may point to the increased sample complexity due to the dual communication and action policy learning. In the social shadowing scenario, heterogeneous agents can learn to generate a communication policy without learning the action policy of the watched expert agents. To enable social shadowing, the agent will alternate between a batch of traditional MARL (no expert) and (1st-person) shadowing an expert agent performing the task in its trajectory.\nThe agent only uses the contrastive objective to update its communication policy during shadowing. In figure , the agent that performs social shadowing is able to learn the action policy with almost half the sample complexity required by the online reinforcement learning agent. Our results show that the structured latent space of the emergent communication learns socially benevolent coordination.\nThis tests our hypothesis that by learning communication to understand the actions of other agents, one can enable lower sample complexity coordination. Thus, it mitigates the issues of solely observing actions.\n\nDiscussion",
                "Multi-Agent Signaling\n\nImplicit communication conveys information to other agents that is not intentionally communicated . Implicit signaling conveys information to other agents based on one's observable physical position . Implicit signaling may be a form of implicit communication such as through social cues or explicit communication such as encoded into the MDP through \"cheap talk\" .\nUnlike implicit signaling, explicit signaling is a form of positive signaling that seeks to directly influence the behavior of other agents in the hopes that the new information will lead to active listening. Multi-agent emergent communication is a type of explicit signaling which deliberately shares information.\nSymbolic communication, a subset of explicit communication, seeks to send a subset of pre-defined messages. However, these symbols must be defined by an expert and do not scale to particularly complex observations and a large number of agents. Emergent communication aims to directly influence other agents with a learned subset of information, which allows for scalability and interpretability by new agents.\n\nEmergent Communication\n\nSeveral methodologies currently exist to increase the informativeness of emergent communication. With discrete and clustered continuous communication, the number of observed distinct communication tokens is far below the number permissible . As an attempt to increase the emergent \"vocabulary\" and decrease the data required to converge to an informative communication \"language\", work has added a bias loss to emit distinct tokens in different situations .\nMore recent work has found that the sample efficiency can be further improved by grounding communication in observation space with a supervised reconstruction loss . Information-maximizing autoencoders aim to maximize the state reconstruction accuracy for each agent. How-ever, grounding communication in observations has been found to easily satisfy these input-based objectives while still requiring a myriad more samples to explore to find a task-specific communication space .\nThus, it is necessary to use task-specific information to communicate informatively. This will enable learned compression for task completion rather than pure compression for input recovery. Other work aims to use the information bottleneck to decrease the entropy of messages . In our work, we use contrastive learning to increase representation similarity with future goals, which we show optimally optimizes the Q-function for messages.\n\nNatural Language Inspiration",

                "Mutual information, denoted as I(X; Y ), looks to measure the relationship between random variables, which is often measured through Kullback-Leibler divergence , I(X; Y ) = D KL (p(x, y)||p(x) \u2297 p(y)). The message encoding substage can be defined as an information bottleneck problem, which defines a tradeoff between the complexity of information (compression, I(X, X)) and the preserved relevant information (utility, I( X, Y )).\nThe deep variational information bottleneck defines a trade-off between preserving useful information and compression . We assume that our observation and memory/sequence encoder provides an optimal representation H i suitable for sharing relevant observation and intent/coordination information. We hope to recover a representation Y i , which contains the sufficient desired outputs.\nIn our scenario, the information bottleneck is a trade-off between the complexity of information I(H i ; M i ) (representing the encoded information exactly) and representing the relevant information I(M j =i ; Y i ), which is signaled from our contrastive objective. In our setup, the relevant information flows from other agents through communication, signaling a combination of the information bottleneck and a Lewis game.\nWe additionally promote complexity through our compositional independence objective, This is formulated by the following Lagrangian, where the bounds on mutual information \u00ce are defined in equations 1, 2, and 10. Overall, our objective is,\n\nComplexity through Compositional Communication",
                "Communication Utility Results\n\nDue to coordination in MARL, grounding communication in referential features is not enough. Finding the communication utility requires grounding messages in ordinal information. Overall, figure shows that our compositional, contrastive method outperforms all methods focused on solely input-oriented communication grounding.\nIn the blind traffic junction, our method yields a higher average task success rate and is able to achieve it with a lower sample complexity. Training with the contrastive update tends to spike to high success but not converge, often many episodes before convergence, which leaves area for training improvement.\nThat is, the contrastive update begins to find aligned latent spaces early in training, but it cannot adapt the methodology quickly enough to converge. The exploratory randomness of most of the early online data prevents exploitation of the high utility f + examples. This leaves further room for improvement for an adaptive contrastive loss term.\nRegularization loss convergence After convergence to high task performance, the autoencoder loss increases in order to represent the coordination information. This follows directly from the information bottleneck, where there exists a tradeoff between utility and complexity. However, communication, especially referential communication, should have an overlap between utility and complexity.\nThus, we should seek to make the complexity loss more convex. Our compositional communication complexity loss does not converge before task performance convergence. While the complexity loss tends to spike in the exploratory phase, the normalized value is very small. Interestingly, the method eventually converges as the complexity loss converges below a normal- ized 0.3.\nAdditionally, the contrastive loss tends to decrease monotonically and converges after the task performance converges, showing a very smooth decrease. The contrastive f \u2212 loss decreases during training, which may account for success spikes prior to convergence. The method is able to converge after only a moderate decrease in the f + loss.\nThis implies empirical evidence that the contrastive loss is an optimal critic for messaging.

The Pascal VOC Game is a two-agent referential game where agents observe images with two unique labels and must communicate to correctly identify both labels.

An ablation study of the loss parameter \u03b2 in a blind traffic junction scenario shows that higher complexity and independence losses increase sample complexity. When \u03b2 = 1, the model fails to converge, but without regularization, the model performs worse due to a stronger causal relationship learned by the independence criteria. The emergent language using the methodology converges to the exact number of observations and intents needed for the task, with no redundancy when \u03b2 = 0.1. The independent information loss leads to a discrete number of tokens in the vocabulary, and empirical results show near-zero independence loss, automatically compressing message size to the smallest necessary.",

They also propose a 'social shadowing' learning method, which combines social learning and imitation learning, using first-person observations to help novice agents develop an understanding of intent. This method alternates between social shadowing and traditional multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) during training. The study concludes with the demonstration that contrastive learning is effective for developing internal models and relationships through social shadowing, facilitating better coordination among agents, even with minimal bandwidth.",

These tokens are concatenated to form \"sentences\" in emergent communication.\n\nThe setup is modeled as a decentralized, partially observable Markov Decision Process with communication (Dec-POMDP-Comm). It involves states (S), actions (A), communications (M) for N agents, state transitions (T), observations (\u2126), and a reward function (R) with a discount factor (\u03b3). Communication is essential due to partial observability, enabling successful task completion.",

It compares this methodology to ae-comm, demonstrating that concepts should derive from independent task signals rather than input reconstruction. The proposed methodology significantly outperforms ae-comm and a no-comm baseline, correctly guessing more labels across agents due to its ability to learn compositional, mutually independent concepts.\n\nIn the social shadowing scenario, heterogeneous agents learn a communication policy without action policy learning, reducing sample complexity. By alternating between traditional MARL and shadowing expert agents, the agent updates its communication policy using a contrastive objective. This approach shows nearly half the sample complexity of online reinforcement learning, indicating that learning communication to understand other agents' actions can enable more efficient coordination. This supports the hypothesis that communication learning can mitigate the complexity of solely observing actions.",
                "Multi-Agent Signaling involves both implicit and explicit communication methods. Implicit signaling conveys information through observable physical positions, which can be either social cues or encoded into the MDP through \"cheap talk.\" Explicit signaling, on the other hand, directly influences other agents' behavior through deliberate information sharing, such as multi-agent emergent communication. Symbolic communication, a subset of explicit communication, uses predefined messages but requires expert definition and struggles with scalability. Emergent communication, aiming to influence other agents with learned information, offers scalability and interpretability.\n\nEmergent Communication methodologies focus on increasing informativeness through discrete and clustered continuous communication, aiming to expand the \"vocabulary\" and reduce data requirements. Recent approaches include grounding communication in observation space with supervised reconstruction losses and using information-maximizing autoencoders to improve state reconstruction accuracy. However, these methods often prioritize input recovery over task-specific communication. Task-specific information is crucial for effective communication, and techniques like contrastive learning can optimize the Q-function for messages by increasing representation similarity with future goals.",

Lemma A.6 states that the probability of a desired goal state (\u03c0 R + (y|m)) is equivalent to the probability of transitioning to that state (p(s = s + f |y, m)) given messages (m) from an emergent language. This is similar to Lemma A.5 but requires assumptions about the information content in messages. Proposition A.7 adapts a Q-function for a goal-conditioned reward function to calculate the probability of a state under a discounted state occupancy measure. Lemma A.8 states that the critic function optimizing a specific equation is a Q-function for the goal-conditioned reward function, representing the similarity between encodings of states and messages. Combining these lemmas and proposition, the text concludes that a specific equation (equation 8) is the NCE-binary objective, which lower bounds mutual information, and the critic function is constrained to a range using the sigmoid function.",

The proof begins by assuming independence between tokens, leading to a jointly Gaussian compositional message vector. A variational approximation is used to model the distribution of messages given hidden states, and a loss function is defined to minimize the difference between the actual and predicted messages. This leads to a bound on the interaction information.\n\n**Proposition 4.2** provides an upper bound for the mutual information between the composed message and encoded information. The proof involves substituting a variational approximation for the true distribution and using a Gaussian approximation for the marginal distribution of messages. It concludes that there is probabilistic independence between different components of the message vector, leading to an expanded form of the mutual information.\n\nAdditionally, **Proposition 5.1** states that the utility mutual information is lower bounded by the contrastive NCE-binary objective, though the proof for this proposition is not fully detailed in the provided text.",

In the Blind Traffic Junction, ten agents must navigate a junction without observing other agents, relying only on their own state location to avoid collisions. The training uses the REINFORCE algorithm. The Pascal VOC Game is a two-agent referential game where agents observe images with two unique labels and must communicate to correctly identify both labels. The agents are trained with PPO, and the dataset consists of 534 unique images with exactly two labels from a subset of five labels.

When \u03b2 = 1, the model fails to converge, but without regularization, the model performs worse due to a stronger causal relationship learned by the independence criteria. The emergent language using the methodology converges to the exact number of observations and intents needed for the task, with no redundancy when \u03b2 = 0.1. The independent information loss leads to a discrete number of tokens in the vocabulary, and empirical results show near-zero independence loss, automatically compressing message size to the smallest necessary.",

Ordinal information is necessary to find communication utility.\n\n2. **Method Performance**: The compositional, contrastive method outperforms other input-oriented communication grounding methods.\n\n3. **Blind Traffic Junction**: The method achieves higher average task success rates with lower sample complexity. However, training with contrastive updates spikes to high success but does not converge, indicating room for improvement.\n\n4. **Contrastive Update Challenges**: Early in training, contrastive updates find aligned latent spaces but fail to adapt quickly enough to converge. Exploratory randomness in early data prevents exploitation of high utility examples.\n\n5. **Adaptive Contrastive Loss**: There is potential for improvement in an adaptive contrastive loss term to address the convergence issue.\n\n6. **Regularization Loss**: After high task performance convergence, autoencoder loss increases to represent coordination information, reflecting a tradeoff between utility and complexity.\n\n7. **Complexity Loss**: The compositional communication complexity loss does not converge before task performance. However, it eventually converges when the complexity loss drops below a normalized 0.3.\n\n8. **Contrastive Loss Behavior**: The contrastive loss decreases monotonically and converges after task performance, suggesting it is an optimal critic for messaging.\n\n9. **Heterogeneous Alignment**: The method demonstrates effective heterogeneous alignment through communication.",

It compares this methodology to ae-comm, demonstrating that concepts should derive from independent task signals rather than input reconstruction. The proposed methodology significantly outperforms ae-comm and a no-comm baseline, correctly guessing more labels across agents due to its ability to learn compositional, mutually independent concepts.\n\nIn the social shadowing scenario, heterogeneous agents learn a communication policy without action policy learning, reducing sample complexity. By alternating between traditional MARL and shadowing expert agents, the agent updates its communication policy using a contrastive objective. This approach shows nearly half the sample complexity of online reinforcement learning, indicating that learning communication to understand other agents' actions can enable more efficient coordination. This supports the hypothesis that communication learning can mitigate the complexity of solely observing actions.",

The proof begins by assuming independence between tokens, leading to a jointly Gaussian compositional message vector. A variational approximation is used to model the distribution of messages given hidden states, and a loss function is defined to minimize the difference between the actual and predicted messages. This leads to a bound on the interaction information.\n\n**Proposition 4.2** provides an upper bound for the mutual information between the composed message and encoded information. The proof involves substituting a variational approximation for the true distribution and using a Gaussian approximation for the marginal distribution of messages. It concludes that there is probabilistic independence between different components of the message vector, leading to an expanded form of the mutual information.\n\nAdditionally, **Proposition 5.1** states that the utility mutual information is lower bounded by the contrastive NCE-binary objective, though the proof for this proposition is not fully detailed in the provided text.",

On this basis, and using the family of infalling observers that is characteristic for the Gullstrand-Painlev\\'e solution, we wrote down the metric in the form (\\ref{preMetric}), with a single unknown function $\\beta(r)$. From the simplified form (\\ref{EinsteinVacuum}) of the vacuum Einstein equations, as applied to a test ball in free fall alongside one of our family of observers, we were able to determine $\\beta(r)$, up to two integration constants. By using the Einstein equation, we escape the restrictions imposed on simplified derivations by Gruber et al.\\cite{Gruber1988} \n\nFrom the initial condition for our infalling observers, as well as from the Newtonian limit at large distances from our center of symmetry, we were able to fix the values of the two intergration constants. Our derivation does not require knowledge of advanced mathematical concepts beyond the ability to properly interpret a given metric line element $\\mathrm{d} s^2$. Even our analysis of tidal effects proceeds via a simple second-order Taylor expansion, leading to differential equations for $\\beta(r)$ that are readily solved using two applications of the method of separation of variables. \n\nWhat is new about the derivation presented here is the combination of the Baez-Bunn equations with the infalling coordinates typical for the Gullstrand-Painlev\\'e form of the metric --- this combination is what, in the end, makes our derivation particularly simple. In turn, this simplicity is what should make the derivation particularly useful in the context of teaching general relativity in an undergraduate setting.\n\nThe derivation proceeds close to the physics, and gives ample opportunity to discuss interesting properties of Einstein's theory of gravity. Students who are presented with this derivation, either as a demonstration or as a (guided) exercise, will come to understand the way that symmetries determine the form of a metric, the deductions that can be made from Einstein's equivalence principle, and last but not least that we need to go beyond the equivalence principle, and consider tidal forces, to completely define our solution.\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgements}",
                "Note that equation (\\ref{EinsteinVacuum}) also holds true in Newtonian gravity. So in a way, this version of Einstein's equation can be seen as a second-order extension of the usual Einstein equivalence principle: Ordinarily, the equivalence principle is a statement about physics in the absence of tidal forces. Equation (\\ref{EinsteinVacuum}) adds to this that the lowest-order correction for tidal forces in a freely falling reference frame is that specified by Newtonian gravity. This makes sense, since by going into a free-fall frame, and restricting our attention to a small spacetime region, we have automatically created a weak-gravity situation. In such a situation, tidal corrections are approximately the same as those described by Newton. This argument can serve as a heuristic justification of (\\ref{EinsteinVacuum}).\n\nIn 2017, Kassner made use of the Baez-Bunn form of Einstein's vacuum equation to derive the Schwarzschild solution, starting from what we have encountered as the static form of the metric (\\ref{StaticForm}).\\cite{Kassner2017} We follow the same general recipe, but using the infalling coordinates introduced in section \\ref{Sec:InfallingObservers}, which makes our derivation even simpler.",
                "As a next step, we transform our metric (\\ref{StaticForm}) from the static form into the form appropriate for our coordinate choice $r$ and $T$. We do so by writing the static time coordinate as a function ${t}(T,r)$ in terms of infalling observer time and radius value. In consequence,\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathrm{d} {t} = \\frac{\\partial{t}}{\\partial T}\\cdot\\mathrm{d} T+ \\frac{\\partial {t}}{\\partial r}\\cdot\\mathrm{d} r,\n\\end{equation}\nand our new metric now has the form\n\\begin{align}\n \\mathrm{d} s^2 = {} & -c^2 F(r)\\left(\\frac{\\partial t}{\\partial T}\\right)^2\\mathrm{d} T^2 \\nonumber \\\\[0.2em]\n & -2c^2F(r)\\left(\\frac{\\partial t}{\\partial T}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\partial t}{\\partial r}\\right)\\mathrm{d} T\\:\\mathrm{d} r \\nonumber \\\\[0.2em]\n & +\\left[G(r)-c^2F(r)\\left(\\frac{\\partial t}{\\partial r}\\right)^2\\right]\\mathrm{d} r^2+r^2\\:\\mathrm{d}\\Omega^2.\n \\end{align}\nAt face value, this looks like we are moving the wrong way, away from simplification, since we now have more functions, and they depend on two variables instead of one.\n\nBut in fact, this new formulation paves the way for an even simpler form of the metric. Consider a specific event, which happens at given radius value $r$. In a small region around that event, we will introduce a new coordinate $\\bar{r}$ to parametrize the radial direction. We want this coordinate to be co-moving with our infalling observers at $r$; each such observer then has a position $\\bar{r}=const.$ that does not change over time.",
                "\\section{Infalling observer coordinates}\n\\label{Sec:InfallingObservers}\n\nNow that we know what the radial directions are, at each moment of time ${t}$, we follow Visser\\cite{Visser2005} as well as Hamilton and Lisle\\cite{HamiltonLisle2008} in defining a family of radially infalling observers.  Observers in that family are in free fall along the radial direction, starting out at rest at infinity: In mapping each observer's radial progression in terms of the static coordinate time ${t}$, we adjust initial conditions, specifically: the choice of initial speed at some fixed time ${t}$, in just the right way that the radial coordinate speed goes to zero for each observer in the same way as $r\\to\\infty.$\n\nIt is true that talking about ``infalling'' observers already reflects our expectation that our solution should describe the spacetime of a spherically symmetric mass.  As we know from the Newtonian limit, such a mass attracts test particles in its vicinity. It should be noted, though, that all our calculations would also be compatible with the limit of no mass being present. In that case, ``infalling'' would be a misnomer, as our family of observers would merely hover in empty space at unchanging positions in $r$. \n\nWe can imagine infinitesimal local coordinate systems associated with our observers --- think of the observer mapping out space and time by defining three orthogonal axes, and by measuring time with a co-moving clock. We assume all such little coordinate systems to be non-rotating --- otherwise, we would break spherical symmetry, since rotation would locally pick out a plane of rotation that is distinguishable from the other planes. The radial direction is a natural choice for the first space axis of those little free-falling systems. The other directions, we take to point to observers falling side by side with our coordinate-defining observer --- and to remain pointed at a specific such other observer, once the choice of direction is made.",
                "Key to our next step is that we {\\em know} the metric for the local length and time measurements made by any one of our free-falling observers. By Einstein's equivalence principle, the metric is that of special relativity. Locally, namely whenever tidal effects can be neglected, spacetime geometry for any non-rotating observer in free fall is indistinguishable from Minkowski spacetime as described by a local inertial system.\n\nSince we have chosen both the time coordinate $T$ and the physical meaning of the radial coordinate $r$ so as to conform with the measurements of the local infalling observer, the transformation between $\\bar{r}$ and $r$ is particularly simple: It has the form of a Galilei transformation\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathrm{d}\\bar{r}= \\mathrm{d} r + \\beta(r)c\\:\\mathrm{d} T.\n\\label{barRshift}\n\\end{equation}\nIn that way, as it should be by definition, radial coordinate differences at constant $T$ are the same in both systems, while for an observer at constant $\\bar{r},$ with $\\mathrm{d} \\bar{r}=0$, the relation between $\\mathrm{d} r$ and $\\mathrm{d} T$ is consistent with the definition of the function $\\beta(r)$ in (\\ref{betaDefinition}).\n\nAre you surprised that this is not a Lorentz transformation, as one might expect from special relativity? Don't be. We are not transforming from one local inertial coordinate system to another. The $T$ is already the time coordinate of the infalling observers, so both coordinate systems have the same definition of simultaneity, and time dilation plays no role in this particular transformation. Also, we have chosen $r$ intervals to correspond to length measurements of the infalling observers, so there is no Lorentz contraction, either. It is the consequence of these special choices that gives the relation (\\ref{barRshift}) its simple form.",

The calculation later in this section provides the second part: It will amount to using (\\ref{EinsteinVacuum}) to determine the structure of spacetime, namely the still missing function $\\beta(r)$, and that is the way for mass, in this case: for the absence of mass, to tell spacetime how to curve.",
                "By noting that we have chosen $\\bar{r}$ so that, at the specific spacetime event where we are evaluating the metric, $\\bar{r}=r$, while, for small radial coordinate shifts around that location, we have the relation (\\ref{barRshift}), we can now write down the same metric in the coordinates $T, r, \\vartheta,\\varphi$, namely as\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathrm{d} s^2 = -c^2\\left[\n1-\\beta(r)^2\n\\right] \\mathrm{d} T^2+2c\\beta(r)\\mathrm{d} r\\:\\mathrm{d} T\n+\\mathrm{d} r^2+r^2\\mathrm{d}\\Omega^2.\n\\label{preMetric}\n\\end{equation}\nSince we can repeat that local procedure at any event in our spacetime, this result is our general form of the metric, for all values of $r$.

In order to determine $\\beta(r)$, we need to bring in additional information, namely the Einstein equations, which link the matter content with the geometry of spacetime. For our solution, we only aim to describe the spacetime metric outside whatever spherically-symmetric matter distribution resides in (or around) the center of our spherical symmetry. That amounts to applying the {\\em vacuum Einstein equations}.",
                "Assume that the spacetime we are interested in is spherically symmetric and static. In general relativity, a symmetry amounts to the possibility of being able to choose coordinates that are adapted to the symmetry, at least within a restricted sub-region of the spacetime in question. That the spacetime is static is taken to mean that we can introduce a (non-unique) time coordinate ${t}$ so that our description of spacetime geometry does not depend explicitly on ${t}$, and that space and time are completely separate --- in the coordinates adapted to the symmetry, there are no ``mixed terms'' involving $\\mathrm{d} {t}$ times the differential of a space coordinate in the metric. If we use ${t}$ to slice our spacetime into three-dimensional hyperplanes, each corresponding to ``space at time ${t}$,'' then each of those 3-spaces has the same spatial geometry. A mixed term would indicate that those slices of space would need to be shifted relative to another in order to identify corresponding points. The mixed term's absence indicates that in adapted coordinates, there is no need for such an extra shift. In those coordinates, we can talk about the 3-spaces as just ``space,'' without the need for specifying which of the slices we are referring to.\n\nIn the case of spherical symmetry, we can introduce spherical coordinates that are adapted to the symmetry: a radial coordinate $r$ and the usual angular coordinates $\\vartheta,\\varphi$, so that the spherical shell at constant $r$ has the total area $4\\pi r^2$. In consequence, the part of our metric involving $\\mathrm{d}\\vartheta$ and $\\mathrm{d}\\varphi$ will have the standard form\n\\begin{equation}\nr^2(\\mathrm{d}\\vartheta^2+\\sin^2\\theta\\mathrm{d}\\varphi^2) \\equiv r^2\\mathrm{d}\\Omega^2,\n\\end{equation}\nwhere the right-hand side defines $\\mathrm{d}\\Omega^2$, the infinitesimal solid angle corresponding to each particular combination of $\\mathrm{d}\\vartheta$ and $\\mathrm{d}\\varphi$.",
                "for our function $\\beta$; with another separation of variables, we can re-write this as \n\\begin{equation}\n\\beta\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\beta=C\\frac{\\mathrm{d} r}{r^2}.\n\\end{equation}\nBoth sides are readily integrated up; we can solve the result for $\\beta(r)$ and obtain\n\\begin{equation}\n\\beta(r) = \\sqrt{\n-\\frac{2C}{r} +2D\n},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $D$ is the second integration constant, and where we have chosen the proper sign, since we know that $\\beta(r)>0$. That brings us to the last step: The requirement that, for large values of $r$, the description provided by our solution should correspond to the results from Newtonian gravity. First of all, we note that our initial condition for the infalling observers, which had those observers start out at zero speed at infinity, means that we must choose $D=0$. Then, as we would expect, $\\beta(r)$ for large values of $r$ becomes very small, corresponding to small speeds. But at slow speeds, time and length intervals as measured by the infalling observer will become arbitrarily close to time and length intervals as measured by an observer at rest in our static coordinate system at constant $r$, using the static time coordinate ${t}$. As is usual, we identify these coordinates with those of an approximately Newtonian description. In that description, the radial velocity is\n\\begin{equation}\nv(r) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}},\n\\end{equation}\nwhich follows directly from energy conservation for the sum of each observer's kinetic and Newtonian-gravitational potential energy. This fixes the remaining integration constant as\n\\begin{equation}\nC = -\\frac{GM}{c^2},\n\\end{equation}\nand the final form of our function $\\beta(r)$ becomes\n\\begin{equation}\n\\beta(r) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{rc^2}}.\n\\end{equation}\nInserting this result in (\\ref{preMetric}), we obtain the metric",
                "In what follows, we will use the basic structures introduced in this way --- the slices of simultaneous ${t}$, the radial directions within each slice, the angular coordinates spanning the symmetry--adapted spherical shells of area $4\\pi r^2$ --- as auxiliary structures for introducing spacetime coordinates. For now, let us write down the shape that our metric has by simple virtue of the spherical symmetry, the requirement that the spacetime be static, and the adapted coordinates, namely\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathrm{d} s^2 = -c^2F(r) \\mathrm{d} {t}^2 + G(r) \\mathrm{d} r^2 + r^2\\:\\mathrm{d}\\Omega^2. \n\\label{StaticForm}\n\\end{equation}\nStudents familiar with  ``reading'' a spacetime metric will immediately recognize the sign difference between the parts describing space and describing time that is characteristic for spacetime, and the speed of light $c$ that gives us the correct physical dimensions. That there is no explicit dependence on $\\varphi$ and $\\vartheta$ in the remaining functions $F$ and $G$ is a direct consequence of spherical symmetry. That the factor in front of $\\mathrm{d}\\Omega^2$ is $r^2$ is a consequence of our coordinate choice, with spherical angular coordinates so that the area of a spherical surface of constant radius $r$ is $4\\pi r^2$. That there is no explicit dependence on ${t}$ is one consequence of the spacetime being static; the absence of the mixed term $\\mathrm{d} {t}\\cdot \\mathrm{d} r$ is another.

But there is a short-cut. The only consequence of those additional velocity terms will be to change the terms linear in $\\Delta T$ in equations (\\ref{dParallel}) and (\\ref{dPerp}). And we already know the end result: We will choose the additional terms so as to cancel the terms linear in $\\Delta T$ in the current versions of (\\ref{dParallel}) and (\\ref{dPerp}). But by that reasoning, we can skip the explicit steps in between, and write down the final result right away.

The metric component involving angular differentials takes the standard form \\( r^2(\\mathrm{d}\\vartheta^2 + \\sin^2\\vartheta \\mathrm{d}\\varphi^2) \\), denoted as \\( r^2 \\mathrm{d}\\Omega^2 \\).\n\nThe metric for a spherically symmetric, static spacetime is given by:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{d} s^2 = -c^2F(r) \\mathrm{d} {t}^2 + G(r) \\mathrm{d} r^2 + r^2\\: \\mathrm{d}\\Omega^2,\n\\]\nwhere \\( F(r) \\) and \\( G(r) \\) are unknown functions of the radial coordinate \\( r \\). This metric reflects the spherical symmetry and static nature of the spacetime, with no dependence on the angular coordinates or the time coordinate. The absence of a mixed term \\( \\mathrm{d} {t} \\cdot \\mathrm{d} r \\) further indicates the static nature of the spacetime.\n\nIn Section 3, \"Infalling Observer Coordinates,\" the authors define a family of radially infalling observers who are in free fall along the radial direction, starting from rest at infinity. These observers use infinitesimal local coordinate systems that are non-rotating to maintain spherical symmetry. This concept is applicable even in the absence of mass, where \"infalling\" would be a misnomer.",
                        "The text discusses the synchronization and behavior of clocks for infalling observers in a static, spherically symmetric spacetime. It begins by establishing that these observers' clocks are synchronized at a fixed radius \\( r \\), maintaining this synchronization due to the spacetime's symmetry. The proper time \\( T \\) shown on these clocks is consistent for all infalling observers at any given radius \\( r \\).\n\nThe text then explores the coordinate speed of these infalling observers, expressing their proper time rate and radial coordinate speed in terms of \\( r \\) and \\( t \\). This leads to the derivation of the rate of change in radial position \\( r \\) with proper time \\( T \\), denoted as \\( \\beta(r) \\), which is rescaled by the speed of light to be dimensionless and ensures positivity for infalling particles.\n\nThe physical interpretation of \\( \\mathrm{d} r \\) as the physical length measured by an infalling observer at constant \\( T \\) is extended to orthogonal directions, ensuring consistent length measurements. The transformation of the static metric into a form suitable for infalling observer coordinates \\( T \\) and \\( r \\) introduces a new radial coordinate \\( \\bar{r} \\) that co-moves with these observers, simplifying the metric.\n\nLocally, the spacetime geometry for non-rotating, free-falling observers is described by the Minkowski metric due to Einstein's equivalence principle. The transformation between coordinates \\( \\bar{r} \\) and \\( r \\) is a Galilei transformation, reflecting the shared definitions of simultaneity and length measurements.\n\nThe metric in locally co-moving coordinates \\( T, \\bar{r}, \\vartheta, \\varphi \\) is derived from the Minkowski metric in Cartesian coordinates, resulting in a simplified form that depends on the function \\( \\beta(r) \\). The determination of \\( \\beta(r) \\) involves applying the vacuum Einstein equations, which relate the matter content to the geometry of spacetime, particularly for describing the metric outside a spherically symmetric matter distribution.\n\nIn summary, the text focuses on the synchronization and local behavior of infalling observers in a static, spherically symmetric spacetime, leading to a simplified metric form that relies on the function \\( \\beta(r) \\) and the application of Einstein's equations."

This system considers a small sphere of freely floating test particles, called a \"test ball,\" which is initially at rest. The volume of this test ball, denoted as \\( V(\\tau) \\), remains constant to the second order in the absence of matter or energy, as indicated by the second derivative of the volume with respect to proper time being zero at \\(\\tau = 0\\).\n\n2. **Equivalence Principle and Newtonian Gravity**:\n   - The equivalence of a specific equation (referred to as \\(\\eqref{EinsteinVacuum}\\)) in both Newtonian gravity and Einstein's theory is discussed. This equation is seen as a second-order extension of the Einstein equivalence principle, which typically addresses physics without tidal forces. The equation adds a Newtonian correction for tidal forces in free-fall frames, supporting its validity in weak-gravity scenarios where tidal effects align with Newtonian predictions.\n\n3. **Test Particles and Infalling Coordinates**:\n   - A scenario involving five test particles in a small region of space is described.

The first derivative term is related to \\( \\beta(r) \\), and the second derivative term simplifies to \\( c^2 \\beta \\cdot \\beta' \\). Introducing the abbreviation \\( B(r) = \\beta(r) \\cdot \\beta'(r) \\), the Taylor expansion is rewritten in a simplified form.\n\n5. **Time Evolution of Radial Positions**:\n   - The time evolution of the radial position \\( r_C(T) \\) for the central particle is derived by setting \\( r_0 = R \\). For particles \\( U \\) and \\( D \\), the expression is evaluated at \\( r_0 = R \\pm \\Delta l \\), using a Taylor expansion of \\( \\beta(r) \\) and its derivative around \\( r = R \\), retaining only linear terms in \\( \\Delta l \\).

The horizontal distance \\( d_{\\perp}(T) \\) between particles \\( L \\) and \\( R \\) changes proportionally to the radius value, expressed by a specific equation involving \\( \\beta(R) \\) and \\( B(R) \\).\n\nOverall, the documents collectively explore the application of the vacuum Einstein equations in a locally flat free-fall system, the equivalence principle in both Newtonian and Einsteinian contexts, and the detailed analysis of the motion and distances of test particles in such a system.",

                    "The Schwarzschild solution is a fundamental concept in general relativity, particularly useful for teaching the interpretation of metrics in undergraduate courses that introduce general relativity without extensive mathematical formalism. It describes the gravitational field around spherical mass distributions, such as black holes and the Sun. Two popular teaching approaches, the \"calculus only\" approach by Taylor and Wheeler and the \"physics first\" approach by Hartle, focus on interpreting given metrics rather than deriving them. A straightforward derivation of the Schwarzschild solution that avoids advanced formalism is beneficial for these courses.\n\nA simplified derivation of the Schwarzschild solution is presented, requiring only basic knowledge of spacetime metrics. This derivation avoids criticisms of previous methods by using a simplified version of the vacuum Einstein equation and symmetry restrictions. The author employs \"infalling coordinates,\" associated with the Gullstrand-Painlev\u00e9 form of the Schwarzschild metric, which simplifies the argument and reduces the derivation to solving an ordinary differential equation for a single function.\n\nIn spherically symmetric and static spacetimes, coordinates can be chosen to align with the symmetry, ensuring that the spacetime geometry does not depend on the time coordinate \\( t \\). This separation of space and time simplifies the description of space. Spherical coordinates \\( r, \\vartheta, \\varphi \\) are used, where the radial coordinate \\( r \\) defines spherical shells with area \\( 4\\pi r^2 \\). The metric component involving angular differentials takes the standard form \\( r^2(\\mathrm{d}\\vartheta^2 + \\sin^2\\vartheta \\mathrm{d}\\varphi^2) \\), denoted as \\( r^2 \\mathrm{d}\\Omega^2 \\).\n\nThe metric for a spherically symmetric, static spacetime is given by:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{d} s^2 = -c^2F(r) \\mathrm{d} {t}^2 + G(r) \\mathrm{d} r^2 + r^2\\: \\mathrm{d}\\Omega^2,\n\\]\nwhere \\( F(r) \\) and \\( G(r) \\) are unknown functions of the radial coordinate \\( r \\). This metric reflects the spherical symmetry and static nature of the spacetime, with no dependence on the angular coordinates or the time coordinate. The absence of a mixed term \\( \\mathrm{d} {t} \\cdot \\mathrm{d} r \\) further indicates the static nature of the spacetime.\n\nIn Section 3, \"Infalling Observer Coordinates,\" the authors define a family of radially infalling observers who are in free fall along the radial direction, starting from rest at infinity. These observers use infinitesimal local coordinate systems that are non-rotating to maintain spherical symmetry. This concept is applicable even in the absence of mass, where \"infalling\" would be a misnomer.",
                    "The text discusses the synchronization and behavior of clocks for infalling observers in a static, spherically symmetric spacetime. It begins by establishing that these observers' clocks are synchronized at a fixed radius \\( r \\), maintaining this synchronization due to the spacetime's symmetry. The proper time \\( T \\) shown on these clocks is consistent for all infalling observers at any given radius \\( r \\).\n\nThe text then explores the coordinate speed of these infalling observers, expressing their proper time rate and radial coordinate speed in terms of \\( r \\) and \\( t \\). This leads to the derivation of the rate of change in radial position \\( r \\) with proper time \\( T \\), denoted as \\( \\beta(r) \\), which is rescaled by the speed of light to be dimensionless and ensures positivity for infalling particles.\n\nThe physical interpretation of \\( \\mathrm{d} r \\) as the physical length measured by an infalling observer at constant \\( T \\) is extended to orthogonal directions, ensuring consistent length measurements. The transformation of the static metric into a form suitable for infalling observer coordinates \\( T \\) and \\( r \\) introduces a new radial coordinate \\( \\bar{r} \\) that co-moves with these observers, simplifying the metric.\n\nLocally, the spacetime geometry for non-rotating, free-falling observers is described by the Minkowski metric due to Einstein's equivalence principle. The transformation between coordinates \\( \\bar{r} \\) and \\( r \\) is a Galilei transformation, reflecting the shared definitions of simultaneity and length measurements.\n\nThe metric in locally co-moving coordinates \\( T, \\bar{r}, \\vartheta, \\varphi \\) is derived from the Minkowski metric in Cartesian coordinates, resulting in a simplified form that depends on the function \\( \\beta(r) \\). The determination of \\( \\beta(r) \\) involves applying the vacuum Einstein equations, which relate the matter content to the geometry of spacetime, particularly for describing the metric outside a spherically symmetric matter distribution.\n\nIn summary, the text focuses on the synchronization and local behavior of infalling observers in a static, spherically symmetric spacetime, leading to a simplified metric form that relies on the function \\( \\beta(r) \\) and the application of Einstein's equations.",

This system considers a small sphere of freely floating test particles, called a \"test ball,\" which is initially at rest. The volume of this test ball, denoted as \\( V(\\tau) \\), remains constant to the second order in the absence of matter or energy, as indicated by the second derivative of the volume with respect to proper time being zero at \\(\\tau = 0\\).\n\n2. **Equivalence Principle and Newtonian Gravity**:\n   - The equivalence of a specific equation (referred to as \\(\\eqref{EinsteinVacuum}\\)) in both Newtonian gravity and Einstein's theory is discussed. This equation is seen as a second-order extension of the Einstein equivalence principle, which typically addresses physics without tidal forces. The equation adds a Newtonian correction for tidal forces in free-fall frames, supporting its validity in weak-gravity scenarios where tidal effects align with Newtonian predictions.\n\n3. **Test Particles and Infalling Coordinates**:\n   - A scenario involving five test particles in a small region of space is described.

Introducing the abbreviation \\( B(r) = \\beta(r) \\cdot \\beta'(r) \\), the Taylor expansion is rewritten in a simplified form.\n\n5. **Time Evolution of Radial Positions**:\n   - The time evolution of the radial position \\( r_C(T) \\) for the central particle is derived by setting \\( r_0 = R \\). For particles \\( U \\) and \\( D \\), the expression is evaluated at \\( r_0 = R \\pm \\Delta l \\), using a Taylor expansion of \\( \\beta(r) \\) and its derivative around \\( r = R \\), retaining only linear terms in \\( \\Delta l \\). The distance between the upper and lower particles, \\( d_{\\parallel}(T) \\), changes over time according to a specific equation.\n\n6. **Horizontal Distance and Radial Distance**:\n   - The radial distance \\( r_{L,R}(t) \\) for particles \\( L \\) and \\( R \\) is approximately equal to \\( R \\), neglecting higher-order terms in \\( \\Delta l \\). The horizontal distance \\( d_{\\perp}(T) \\) between particles \\( L \\) and \\( R \\) changes proportionally to the radius value, expressed by a specific equation involving \\( \\beta(R) \\) and \\( B(R) \\).\n\nOverall, the documents collectively explore the application of the vacuum Einstein equations in a locally flat free-fall system, the equivalence principle in both Newtonian and Einsteinian contexts, and the detailed analysis of the motion and distances of test particles in such a system.",

About 80% of those with clinical disease recover at this point, with permanent immunity. The other 20% enter the toxic stage, with a return of the fever, black vomit (coffee-ground emesis), diarrhea, a slowing of the pulse (Faget's sign), jaundice, yellow eyes, yellow skin, and failure of the kidneys, liver, and heart. The patient gets a strange hiccup (like with Ebola, a related disease), falls into a coma, and dies. About half of those patients who enter the toxic stage dies, even now, even with the best of hospital care. The Faget's sign can also occur at the end of the first stage.",
                "You asked specifically about the symptoms of the Americans on Dr. Reed's team who got yellow fever in Cuba in 1900. I'll give the passage from The American Plague (162-5), which describes the course of Jesse Lazear's illness. \"In his logbook, Lazear wrote an unusual entry on September 13. In all cases before those, page after page of records, Lazear had used the soldier's name and simply the date he was bitten, with no other attention to the mosquito. A one-line entry with a name and a date. On that day, however, in his elegant hand, Lazear did not write the soldier's name, but instead wrote 'Guinea Pig No. 1.' He went on to write that this guinea pig had been bitten by a mosquito that developed from an egg laid by a mosquito that developed from an egg laid by a mosquito that fed on a number of yellow fever cases: Suarez, Hern\u00e1ndez, De Long, Fer\u00e1ndez. It was a precise, detailed history that proved beyond doubt that the mosquito was loaded with the virus when it bit a healthy soldier...(If he had entered his name, then his death would have been considered medical suicide by the insurance company, and his wife and two children would not have gotten any payment.) For the next few days, Lazear's life continued much as it had over the last few months in Cuba. He fed and cared for the mosquitoes in the lab. ..Then he began to lose his appetite. He skipped a few meals in the mess hall. He didn't mention it to anyone, nor did he ask to see one of the yellow fever doctors; instead, he worked hard in the lab trying to ignore the oncoming headache.",
                "A special tribute to Del Bigtree (pictured) and his team at ICAN for his stunning 88 page letter to the HHS regarding vaccine safety. As Del reported - in the latest edition of Highwire - the letter, in response to an earlier reply from the then acting Director National Vaccine Program Office, Melinda Wharton, took virtually a year to compile, and is a meticulous piece of research. Most sensationally they researched the HHS claim through US government archives that at least some pediatric vaccines had been trialed against genuine placebo, and came to a negative conclusion. Not only that, they established that none of the vaccines those vaccines had been trialed against had ever been trialed against genuine placebo either. At the end of the line the toxic products were only being compared with other toxic products, rather than against saline.\nLeave aside the sceptics, for any believer in the vaccine program as a necessary intervention in public health, this should be a devastating finding. Fundamentally, the research into the safety of any of the products before marketing was simply not there. The manufacturers apparently had no faith that their proto-products could withstand this scrutiny, and for the rest they just did not care: under the alleged imperative of protecting the population it seems anything went. So even before all the sham monitoring procedures and reviews which Del and his team dismantle in forensic detail we are left with the proposition that none of the present products being given to US children \u2013 and frequently other children across most of the developed world \u2013 have any meaningful pre-marketing safety data all. If you are believer in the program you have been let down: if you wanted a program with any pretensions to safety - supposing such a thing to be possible - it looks like you would have to start from scratch. The manufacturers did this: the governments, the politicians and the regulators (internationally) let it happen.",
                "Hans, you are right that we are looking at one of the biggest crimes in all history. When I read the story of that poor girl who was so healthy and is now confined to a wheelchair after getting her third Gardasil shot I could not believe that Merck could produce such a toxic vaccine and give it out to girls like it was something they absolutely had to have only to be mislead and made into cripples. Merck should be prosecuted for the damage they have done to so many girls who got the Gardasil vaccine and were physically debilitated for life. There is a place for the people who perpetrated this crime on young girls and women and it is called hell. They have destroyed people's lives and gotten away with it. My heart goes out to those who have suffered this damage for no damn good reason except to help make huge profits for Merck!\nHere is the reason that the germ theory is nonsense.\n1) Everyday we are bombarded with billions of germs. Presumably at least some of them are of the kind that germ theorists believe are dangerous (otherwise we would have to conclude that none of them are dangerous). So how do we survive?\n2) Let's just say that we ignore 1 and imagine that, by way of magic, none of the billions of viruses we get bombarded with are pathogenic but all those that are are tucked away somewhere. Ok. But presumably they reside in sick people right? So where are there lots of sick people? Doctor offices and hospitals! So everybody must be dying the moment they enter these places right?\n3) I love this one because I have never seen anybody else ever raise it. Under the germ theory there are no negative feedbacks. This makes a stable biological system by definition impossible. The immune system is *not* a negative feedback it is the opposite. It actually reinforces our math problem because the immune system will weaken as the number of pathogens increase.\nThere is no way of resolving this problem without a discontinuity. A Deus ex Machina as The Almighty Pill so beautifully put it. So the germ theory is quite literally, mathematically impossible.\nThere is as much chance of it being true as 2+2 = 5.",
                "This damning document is published simultaneously with a demand in the UK from the Royal Society for Public Health (which I had never heard of) to shut down comment about vaccines on the web. It echoes calls from Seth Berkley of GAVI, Heidi Larson of the Vaccine Confidence Project and the European Parliament. The pamphlet airily dismisses concerns that vaccines have side effects or that you could possibly have too many. It is pure public relations, and if the RSPH claims to be \"independent\" it also admits that the publication was paid for by Merck, a detail which was reported by British Medical Journal and the Guardian, but not true to form by the BBC. We have, in truth, been building to this moment for two decades: as the evidence piles up that every single aspect of the program lacks integrity or is simply rotten to the core all the perpetrators can do is call for the silencing of their critics, and maintain the products are safe because they say so.\nPlease help give the ICAN letter the widest possible distribution, particularly to politicians.\n\"The outcome of disease always depends both on the virulence of the pathogen and the health of the individual immune system.\"\nNope. This makes no sense. Lots of people who seemed vibrant will get a very severe case of the same illness that a vulnerable baby overcomes in a day.\nAnd under the germ theory it doesn't matter how strong your immune system *was*. Once it's been overcome by the pathogen it is every bit as weak as anybody else's with that pathogen.\nWhat you say makes no sense. There's no reason for me to reply to you again.\n\"Why do you think that within a few years (not many) of the introduction of the vaccines for them, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, Hib disease, and chickenpox (and others) almost entirely disappeared?\"\nWhy do you keep asking this question when I've already provided the answer hundreds of times? Why are you so desperate to believe the people who you already recognize are harming our children?\nWhy would Walter Reed be any more trustworthy than Paul Offit or Senator Pan? Why would Jenner or Pasteur?",
                "As is obvious, there are many problems with vaccines. But, that being said, most of them usually work for a period of time to prevent the targeted diseases. The basic science behind vaccines is correct. Why do you think that within a few years (not many) of the introduction of the vaccines for them, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, Hib disease, and chickenpox (and others) almost entirely disappeared? In the case of the routine childhood diseases, this was a bad thing, but it is a true thing.\nVaccines usually don't cause any obvious reactions. While they usually prevent the diseases, and that's why people continue to get them. With the increasing vaccination schedule, more and more are severely and permanently damaged, and it is immoral to mandate any vaccine for anyone for this reason. But it would also be immoral to prohibit vaccines for those who want them enough to take the risk.\nYour article said as though it had any probative value that 90% of those who get pertussis had been vaxxed. The old DPT vaccine was MUCH more effective at preventing pertussis, but it was so dangerous (again, not to most, but to many), that developed countries replaced it with the acellular version, DTaP. From the beginning about twenty years ago, it was clear that it was not very effective and that huge numbers of vaxxed people got pertussis anyway, including my daughter who got pertussis at eight month old after having gotten three DTaPs. The pertussis vaccine continues to be very dangerous, and I do not recommend that anyone get it. It used to be a killer disease, but evolved to become much milder, to the extent that the disease is very rarely dangerous (usually only to newborns under three months old), while the vaccine is very dangerous. And they're trying to see how they can go back to the old DPT. This does not show that vaccine science has collapsed, but rather that the vaccine they developed to replace the DPT turned out to be much less effective than they first thought, while continuing to be much more dangerous than they first thought.",
                "And you went no way to explaining my arguments against germ theory. If we are attacked by billions of viruses every day then if even a tiny fraction of them are pathogenic then we couldn't possibly survive. And even if we could, we would already be immune rendering every vaccine pointless. Once we had survived our first few days on earth, then we could never get sick again.\nIf that's wrong then we must conclude that precisely 0% of germs are pathogenic.\nPlus your comment about the immune system completely misunderstood my point. The immune system does not allow us to overcome our math problem. In fact, it makes it worse.\nYou did provide one solitary example of a patient with what are presumably yellow fever symptoms but you didn't say whether they had been given any toxic medical treatments.\nAnd like I said before, the whole \"incubation period\" is more than a little suspicious. Clearly they never found what they thought they would and just rigged the results to tell them what they want to hear.\nLike every other germ theorist/vaccine promoter in history.\nMany kinds of bacteria are constantly evolving and changing, like flu viruses. Others are more stable over time, like the yellow fever virus. Those that change develop new ways of infiltrating the cells of the organism being attacked (from our point of view, from its unconscious point of view, it's just carrying out its need to replicate, which it can only do inside the cells of its host). The changes which allow it to better infiltrate are more successful and result in more viruses with those traits.\nOur immune system is designed to detect and destroy potentially dangerous invading pathogens. Many bacteria are usually harmless and absolutely necessary. The minority are dangerous, and most people's immune systems do a good job of analyzing them and killing them, often with no signs of disease. Others experience a clinical infection, and the immune system usually mounts a successful attack on them.",
                "Your article extrapolated from that that modern medical science in general has collapsed, but that, again, is going too far. A older woman in Mexico City who is like my mother to me had a pacemaker inserted about two months ago to aid her failing heart, and it has restored her to optimism and energy, when she was despondent, weak, and close to death. I took my daughter to the dentist yesterday, who said she has three wisdom teeth coming in and that she said that the lower right one was sore. So, although I am cautious about X-rays, I made an appointment for a panoramic X-ray in a month to assess the wisdom teeth, and, if it seems appropriate, I'll take her to an oral surgeon to have one or more extracted under IV sedation, in his office, if possible (the dentist thought that it would be). And I am confident that there will be no serious problems, but this is thanks to technology and training in modern medicine that haven't been available for that long.\nI think that everyone should inform himself on all medical procedures before agreeing to anything, but I also think that he should have access to any medical procedure which is reasonable (and opinions can differ as to that).\nOne problem is that you have not said how you think people should protect themselves against tetanus, bacterial meningitis, and yellow fever in the relevant cases, for example. These are diseases which healthy, well-nourished people used to die from very readily.\nIf most people stopped vaxxing and the mortality from these diseases rose to something like pre-vaccine levels, do you think they should just accept dying from them?\nI put that in a separate paragraph because it is the crucial issue.\nbalinaheuchter Air Traffic Control You Tube - Colin Campbell example of - How to \"Fudge a Nudge\" -\"Deal\" or \"No Deal\" \"Not in a month of Sundays\" \"No exceptions/no compromise?\" -make a trade off -do an exception- everyone get's a good deal /good outcome!",

The grasp sizes then decreases as well in order to apply more normal force. This experiment demonstrates the ability of the controller to handle perturbations in the weight of the object during grasping.",
                "CONCLUSION\n\nIn summary, we presented a controller that uses force feedback integrated with conditional synergies to control a dexterous robotic hand to grasp and release objects. We demonstrated that our controller can lift objects of different weights and materials while avoiding slip, react online when the weight of the object changes, place them down on surfaces, and hand them over to humans.\nIn addition, the control architecture is modular, so the synergy grasp mapping component can be easily changed in order to control several precision grasp types. However, our experiments also revealed various limitations of our controller. For example our method fails to stabilize the object when rotational slip occurs.\nIn addition hardware limitations such as, slow update rates and noise in the force measurements can create problems that result in the object falling. In future work we plan to incorporate additional sensing modalities, such as vision to alleviate some of these issues.",
                "The initial grasp size is set to the maximum value, and when the force controller comes into effect and depending on the state of the system and the forces on the fingertips grasp size changes by some value C, according to equations 1,2, until the desired normal force is achieved. To choose between grasping or releasing an object we use a finite state machine formulation.\nWhen the hand reaches the desired grasp pose, which we assume is provided, the GRASP state is activated, in which the controller tries to grasp the object. When the controller detects that the tangential force applied to the object is coming from a support surface the state changes to the RELEASE state, in which the controller releases the object by opening the grasp.\nYou can see the full algorithm in Python-like pseudocode in Figure . To summarize, the advantages of our controller compared with previous approaches are threefold: 1) instead of controlling each joint of each finger of the hand we use only two variables, the grasp size and the grasp type, which allows us to perform multiple grasp types by changing only one variable while the grasp size variable is common among all grasp types, that greatly reduces the complexity of the control process compared to independently controlling a 21 DoF hand to perform different grasp types, 2) we do not rely on slip prediction for controlling the desired normal force, which involves gathering labeled data and works only for the hand poses in the training dataset, and 3) we can use our controller to also release objects instead of only grasping them.",
                "We present a force feedback controller for a dexterous robotic hand equipped with force sensors on its fingertips. Our controller uses the conditional postural synergies framework to generate the grasp postures, i.e. the finger configuration of the robot, at each time step based on forces measured on the robot's fingertips.\nUsing this framework we are able to control the hand during different grasp types using only one variable, the grasp size, which we define as the distance between the tip of the thumb and the index finger. Instead of controlling the finger limbs independently, our controller generates control signals for all the hand joints in a (lowdimensional) shared space (i.e.\nsynergy space). In addition, our approach is modular, which allows to execute various types of precision grips, by changing the synergy space according to the type of grasp. We show that our controller is able to lift objects of various weights and materials, adjust the grasp configuration during changes in the object's weight, and perform object placements and object handovers.\n\nINTRODUCTION",
                "To gather information about the tactile states they use multiple afferents that are located in the skin of the fingers . There are different afferents in different parts of the hand depending on their usage, e.g. fast adapting afferents in the fingertips for precise manipulation. Based on signals from these afferents, humans encode simple contact events into action phases, such as grasping, lifting or releasing, which they combine in order to perform more complex and long-horizon manipulation tasks .\nIn robotics tactile sensors have been used for object stabilization and slip prediction in a variety of settings. For example, in , a compliant anthropomorphic prosthetic hand was controlled using force sensing to maintain object stability and avoid slip. In , they develop a control approach that uses integrated force and spatial tactile signals to avoid slip with unknown objects in real world settings.\nIn , , grasp quality metrics are computed based on the tactile feedback from the robots fingertips. In these works, simple two or three fingered grippers were considered for simple grasping tasks. Force control with anthropomorphic robotic hands has also been explored in more recent works. In , they employ three slip prediction methods to estimate when slip starts and based on the force signals at that moment they calculate the friction coefficient value.\nBased on the calculated friction coefficient, they design a force controller that independently controls each finger to achieve a desired normal force. The desired normal contact force is set to be proportional to the tangential contact force and a safety margin based on the evidence found in . In , they train a random forest to classify the contact states into the classes: no contact, contact, slip.\nBased on this classification signal, when slip is detected they increase the desired normal contact force to avoid it. In they train a recurrent neural network to estimate slip and the object material from the readings of a Biotac sensor. The force controller is increasing the desired normal contact force when slip is detected.\nAll these works , , use tactile feedback sensors to predict slip. They collect labeled data, on which they train their models. This approach is based on complex and expensive tactile sensors, and the process of collecting data is cumbersome. In addition, the data do not cover all possible hand poses, which would be impractical.",
                "To perform complex manipulation tasks in unstructured environments, humans use tactile feedback from their fingers. This feedback is provided by tactile afferents located in the skin of the hand. Particularly, for handling small objects with precise movements, the afferents located in the fingertips are used, which have high density and adapt fast to pressure changes .\nThese afferents provide information about the characteristics of the exerted contact forces, such as the magnitude and the direction. For anthropomorphic robots to be able to perform dexterous tasks similar force feedback signals must be used to alleviate problems arising from uncertainty in measurements, and handle external perturbations.\nFor example, using open-loop position control to lift a heavy object may fail due to slip without any feedback mechanism to provide tactile information. Previous works have used tactile sensors to design force controllers that use slip prediction to update the desired normal forces applied by the fingertips.\nThe slip predictors are based on machine learning models such as neural networks and random forests to classify multi-modal signals from a tactile sensor. In all previous works, each finger was separately controlled by an independent force controller. In addition, they required labeled data to train the slip predictors and because each finger is controlled independently is not obvious how to implement different anthropomorphic grasp types.\nIn this work we develop a force controller that takes as input the force readings of the fingertips and computes the grasp size which is then used along with a grasp type label to generate a grasp posture with the desired characteristics. To avoid slippage the desired normal contact force is calculated to be proportional to the tangential contact forces.\nThe applied normal force is then controlled using the size of the grasp as a control variable. Larger grasp sizes mean less force is applied to the object. So the grasp size is calculated from the error between the desired normal force and the actual measured normal force. The grasp size is then given to the posture sampler that generates a grasp posture, i.e. the finger joint angles.",
                "You can see the execution of the second experiment in the upper part of Figure . This experiment demonstrates the ability of the controller to handle arbitrary hand poses. The experiment is divided in four parts: 1) the robot enters the GRASP phase and the force controller generates grasps to achieve a normal contact force below the f of f set n threshold, 2) the robot lifts the object and adjusts the grasp size to avoid the object falling, 3) the hand rotates to place the chips can on the horizontal position, and 4) the robot enters the RELEASE phase, and the arm lowers until the object touches the box, when the hand detects the supporting surface, it starts to slowly release the object.\nYou can see the execution of the third experiment in the middle part of Figure . This experiment demonstrates the ability of the controller to perform robot to human handovers. The experiment is divided in four parts: 1) the robot enters the GRASP phase and the force controller generates grasps to achieve a normal contact force below the f of f set n threshold, 2) the robot lifts the object and adjusts the grasp size to avoid the object falling, 3) the hand rotates to place the chips can on the vertical position, and 4) the robot enters the RELEASE phase, the arm stays still, the human grasps the object from the bottom and slightly pushes it up, the hand then detects that there is a supporting surface and starts to slowly release the object.\nYou can see the execution of the fourth experiment in the bottom part of Figure . This experiment is similar to previous one, but the grasp type that the robot uses is a pinch grasp, that involves only the thumb and the index finger. To perform this we only had to alter the grasp type conditional variable that was given to the posture mapping function.\nYou can see the execution of the fifth experiment in the bottom part of Figure . In the first part (blue) of the experiment the robot closes its grasp, by reducing the grasp size, until the normal force is below the force offset. In the next three parts (pink, green, red) the person throws coins in the cup to increase its weight.",
                "Experimental Set-up.\n\nFor our experiments we used the Seed Robotics RH8D Hand , which is a robotic hand with 7 DoFs. The hand is equipped with the FTS-3 force sensors in each fingertip, which are high resolution tactile sensors that provide the 3D force applied in each fingertip. The sensor provides data at a rate of 50Hz. For the experiments the hand was mounted on a Kinova Gen3 7DoF robot.\nTo train the posture mapping function we used the CyberGlove to teleoperate the hand and collect 468 grasps belonging to three precision grasp  types: tripod, pinch, lateral tripod. The architecture of the cVAE model was the same as in , with the addition of the grasp type as a conditional variable, which was one-hot encoded.\nWe used 10 household objects shown in Figure . With the heaviest object weighing 380g and the lightest 1g. During the experiments the trajectories of the arm were prerecorded, while the hand was controlled online by our control algorithm.\n\nParameter tuning.\n\nTo select the values of the parameters in our controllers we conducted preliminary experiments where we tested lifting and releasing several objects, with different physical properties. To select the value of the normal offset force f of f set n , we used an empty plastic cup as our test object, and we choose a value such that the fingers do not deform the cup.\nThe final value of the parameter was set to -50 mN. To select the values of the gain G and the rate of decrease K, of the grasp size, we experimented with the heaviest object in our dataset, which is the mustard bottle and weighs 380g. The gain G was set to 2.0 such that the desired normal force would be enough to hold the object.\nThe rate of change of the grasp size was set to 100.0, based on the operating frequency of the force sensor and the range of values of the tangential force. For the tangential force averaging process we used a parameter value of \u03b1 t = 0.7, because we want the controller to be sensitive to fast changes in its value, that can arise for example during lifting an object.\nFor the normal force averaging process we used a parameter value of \u03b1 n = 0.5, as we do not want it to be affected by noise that could make the controller overconfident.\n\nExperiments.",
                "In this way we can control all the fingers jointly by a single value, the grasp size, thus greatly reducing the control parameters. In addition we are able to use the same control algorithm for different precision grasp types, by changing the grasp type conditional variable. Finally, we can modify our controller to release objects instead of grasping them.\nGiven the pose of the hand in the world coordinate frame, which we can acquire from the robotic arm that is attached to, we can use the forward kinematics of the hand to compute the poses of each fingertip. Then using the force readings of each fingertip we can calculate the global direction of the net tangential force.\nIf the angle between the direction of the net tangential force and the direction of gravity is less than 90 degrees, i.e. the net tangential force's direction is towards the ground, we assume that the tangential force is due to gravity pulling the object, so the force controller tries to grasp it. If the angle is more than 90 degrees, i.e. the net tangential force's direction is upward, it means that something is pushing (or pulling) the object upward, in which case we assume that the object is touching on a support surface or someone is pulling the object so the controller increases the grasp size given to the posture mapping function proportionally to the normal force measured thus slowly releasing the object.\nOpening the grasp is done by controlling the grasp size variable as follows: That way we can place objects on surfaces but also perform robot to human handovers, where the robot holds the object and the human grasps the object and slightly pushes or pulls it up, signaling to the robot that there is a support surface.\nThe robot then slowly releases the object by opening its grasp. We showcase these scenarios in the experiments' section. Based on these observations, we present our force controller in Figure . The hand starts in an open pre-grasp position, a latent point is sampled from the prior distribution of the posture mapping function, and given the desired grasp type and the grasp size a grasp posture, i.e. the joint angles of the fingers, is sampled.",
                "To explore the capabilities of our controller, we demonstrate five experiments of increasing complexity: 1) we picked and placed a bottle using a tripod grasp, 2) we picked, rotated and placed a chips can on a box using a tripod grasp, 3) we picked, rotated and handed over the chips can to a person using a tripod grasp, 4) we picked, rotated and handed over a brown foam brick to a person using a pinch grasp, 5) a person handed over a plastic cup to the robot, filled it with coins to increase its weight, and the robot then handed it back to the person using a tripod grasp.\nYou can see the execution of the first experiment in  In the middle row, for our third experiment, the robot picks up the chips can, rotates it 90 degrees, and hands it over to a person. In the bottom row, for our forth experiment, the robot picks up a foam brick, rotates it 180 degrees, and hands it over to a person, using a pinch grasp.\nFig. . In our fifth experiment, a person hands over an empty plastic cup to the robot, throws coins in it to increase its weight while the robot adjusts its grip to stabilize the object, and then hand overs the cup back to the person. force is below the offset f of f set n , 2) (green part) the robot lifts the object, as it tries to lift the tangential force increases, increasing the threshold, so the grasp size decreases to apply more normal force, 3) (orange part) the robot transports the object, you can see, in point A in the Figure, a perturbation in the tangential force when the robot begins to move, the controller responds by decreasing the grasp thus stabilizing the object, and 4) (blue part) the robot enters the releasing phase, where it lowers the arm until it detects that the tangential force is due to a support surface, then it stops lowering the arm and increases the grasp size slowly releasing the object.\nIn point B in the Figure, you can see that there is noise in the tangential force, due to the arm moving to place the object on the table, that is also reflected in the desired normal force. Because we use the desired normal force as a threshold and not as a reference signal this noise is not manifested in the control of the grasp size.",
                "In contrast, in our work we do not rely on slip prediction, we avoid slip by defining a tangential force gain and a safety margin that work for a large number of objects. Furthermore, instead of independently controlling each finger we use a synergistic framework to generate grasp postures, that is conditioned on two variables: the grasp type and the grasp size.\nThis way, instead of controlling the values of each joint of each finger, we control only the two conditional variables greatly simplifying the control pipeline. This also, gives us the ability to use different grasp types in our manipulation tasks by changing only the grasp type variable. In also a synergistic framework was used to prevent an object from slipping from a humanoid hand, but they modeled only one synergy for a tripod grasp and they used the forces on the robotic arm as feedback, while we use force feedback from the fingertips.\nOur control algorithm could also be applied to different hands as it does not depend on the hands configuration. Finally, in previous approaches only lifting tasks had been considered. In our work we demonstrate that our approach can be used to perform more complex tasks, such as placing objects on surfaces and performing handovers, which was not done in previous works.\nOur goal in this work is to design a control algorithm for an anthropomorphic robotic hand to perform dexterous manipulation skills such as lifting and placing down objects. Our control algorithm will use tactile feedback from the force sensors on the fingertips of the hand to decide the forces that need to be applied to the object in each step of the task.\nGiven the desired forces to be applied, the size of the grasp will be computed. Given the grasp size and a desired grasp type, the posture generator will generate a grasp posture, i.e. the hand configuration, such that the force constraints are satisfied. To model the contacts and friction we use Coulombs' law, which states that in order to avoid slip, the normal contact force f n to the contact surface of an object, times the fiction coefficient \u00b5, has to be larger than the tangential force f t :\n\u00b5f n \u2265 f t You can see an example in Figure , where an object is pressed against a wall by an applied normal force f n , and we have the tangential force f t = mg due to gravity. In order for the object to remain stable we need to apply a normal force: where \u00b5 is the friction coefficient between the object and the wall.",

                "The grasp size represents the distance between the thumb and the index finger in a grasp posture. So a smaller grasp size will result in a tighter grasp and greater normal force applied to the surface of the object. We use a linear controller for the grasp size variable that is implemented as follows: where K is a parameter that controls the rate of decrease of the grasp size, and is experimentally selected.\nSo when the error between the desired normal force and the actual normal force is large the grasp size decreases so tighter grasp postures are generated in order to apply more normal force. In practice, in order to avoid oscillations in the grasp size we use the desired normal force as a high threshold that we want the measured normal force to be below:\nIf the normal force is below that threshold the grasp size does not change even if there are small oscillations in the measured tangential and normal forces. Also, in order to avoid the hand applying too much force that damages the hardware or the object we use a low threshold, that is: where w threshold is the width of the threshold in mN .\nIf the measured normal force is below the grasp size increases in order to apply less force. So the final grasp size variable for grasping is calculated as follows: where This is similar to the deadband control method , where instead of having a fixed reference point, an operating range is set. If the response is in this range, the controller does not exert any correction.\nIn our case, the operating range changes according to the force signals from the robot's fingertips. The grasp posture mapping function is based on the conditional postural synergies model presented in . It uses a conditional Variational Auto-Encoder model to generate grasps postures conditioned on additional variables such as the grasp size.\nIn this work we augment this model to also generate grasp postures conditioned on the grasp type. The model is trained on a set of labeled grasp samples acquired by teleoperating a robotic hand using a data-glove. Using this model we are able to abstract away the low-level control of each joint of each finger and generate grasps based on more general characteristics such as the type and the size of the grasp.",

With this framework we abstract away the low-level control of the fingers and generate hand postures based on high-level properties such as the type and the size of the grasp. So it works as a mapping function that takes as input a low-dimensional vector and the grasp type and size as conditional variables and maps them to a set of joint angles.\nWe show that with our controller we can control a dexterous robotic hand to lift objects of different weights using three precision grasps. Our controller is also able to compensate and retain a stable grasp during changes in the objects' weight, for example when filling up a cup or emptying it. In addition we show how with the addition of the hand pose information we can use the controller to calculate if the tangential force is due to gravity or due to a support surface and use this information to perform handovers and place down objects on surfaces.\nWe perform several real-world experiments with a dexterous robotic hand to showcase the capabilities of our controller and support our design choices.

Neuroscientists have studied for a long time the processes that allow humans to use tactile feedback to perform complex manipulation tasks. Humans tend to adjust the grip force according to the object's weight, its friction and they use a safety margin to account for uncertainties .",
                "In the case of a dexterous hand manipulating an object, we want the normal forces applied by all fingers to be greater than the tangential force divided by the friction coefficient of the materials of the object and the fingertip. Since it is hard to accurately compute the friction coefficient between all possible object materials previous works have used multi-modal tactile sensors like the BioTac sensor, which provides information about the pressure, skin deformation, and temperature, to predict slip and based on that signal to increase the applied normal force.\nIn our work we use the FTS3 sensors which is a low-cost sensor that measures the 3D force applied in each fingertip. In addition, previous works gathered labeled datasets in order to train their slip prediction models which is time-consuming and limits the possible orientations of the hand, because gathering labeled data for all possible orientations is impractical.\nTo overcome this we experimentally selected the parameters that determine the value of the applied normal force such that we avoid slip for all objects in our dataset, from the lightest to the heaviest. In order to guarantee contact between the fingertip and the object, in the beginning of the grasping phase, we use an offset f of f set n as the minimum normal force applied by each finger.\nIn they also suggest that humans use an additional safety margin which is proportional to the tangential force, f margin n \u221d f t . So the final desired normal contact force becomes: where G is the gain that includes the friction coefficient and the additional safety margin. To alleviate the effects of noise in the sensors, the running average of the measured normal force f n and tangential force f t is used, as a low pass filter.\nSo for each force measurement we have the following relation: where \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) is a parameter that determines how much new measurements affect the value, and is experimentally selected. Given the measured normal force f n from the fingertip sensors we can compute the error f err n = f des n \u2212 f n . We use this error signal to control the grasp size variable g size , that we use as a conditional variable in our posture mapping function."

                "abstract\n\nCG:SHOP is an annual geometric optimization challenge and the 2022 edition proposed the problem of coloring a certain geometric graph defined by line segments. Surprisingly, the top three teams used the same technique, called conflict optimization. This technique has been introduced in the 2021 edition of the challenge, to solve a coordinated motion planning problem.\nIn this paper, we present the technique in the more general framework of binary constraint satisfaction problems (binary CSP). Then, the top three teams describe their different implementations of the same underlying strategy. We evaluate the performance of those implementations to vertex color not only geometric graphs, but also other types of graphs.\n\nIntroduction",
                "Lasa team used two approaches to find initial solutions: 1. DSATUR is the classical graph coloring algorithm presented in Section 1. 2. Orientation greedy is almost the only algorithm where the geometry of the segments is used. If segments are almost parallel, it is likely that they do not intersect (thus forming an independent set).\nThis greedy algorithm first sorts the segments by orientation, ranging from \u2212 \u03c0 2 to \u03c0 2 . For each segment in this order, the algorithm tries to color it using the first available color. If no color has been found, a new color is created for coloring the considered segment. This algorithm is efficient, produces interesting initial solutions and takes into account the specificities of the competition.\n\nSolution Initialization\n\nThe gitastrophe team uses the traditional greedy algorithm of Welsh and Powell to obtain initial solutions: order the vertices in decreasing order of degree, and assign each vertex the minimum-label color not used by its neighbors. During the challenge Gitastrophe attempted to use different orderings for the greedy algorithm, such as sorting by the slope of the line segment associated with each vertex (as the orientation greedy initialization presented in Section 3), and also tried numerous other strategies.\nUltimately, after running the solution optimizer for approximately the same amount of time, all initializations resulted in an equal number of colors.\n\nModifications to the Conflict Optimizer\n\nTaking inspiration from memetic algorithms, which alternate between an intensification and a diversification stage, the algorithm continually switched between a phase using the above conflict score, and one minimizing only the number of conflicts. Thus during the conflict-minimization phase, the random variables f (C j ) and w(u) are both fixed equal to 1 leading to a conflict score\nEach phase lasted for 10 5 iterations. Adding the conflict-minimization phase gave minor improvements to some of the challenge instances.\n\nShadoks",
                "While the conflict optimization strategy is simple, there are different ways to apply it to the graph coloring problem. The goal of the paper is to present how the top three teams applied it or complemented it with additional strategies. We compare the relative benefits of each variant on the instances given in the CG:SHOP 2022 challenge.\nWe also compare them to baselines on some instances issued from graph coloring benchmarks. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the details of the conflict optimization strategy applied to graph coloring. In the three sections that follow, the three teams Lasa, Gitastrophe, and Shadoks present the different parameters and modified strategies that they used to make the algorithm more efficient for the CG:SHOP 2022 challenge.\nThe last section is devoted to the experimental results.",
                "Results on DIMACS Graphs\n\nWe tested the implementation of each team on the DIMACS instances to gauge the performance of the conflict optimizer on other classes of graphs. We compared our results to the best known bounds and to the state of the art coloring algorithms HEAD and QACOL . The time limit for Lasa's algorithms is 1 hour.\nCWLS is Lasa's conflict optimizer with the neighbourhood presented in TABUCOL , while PWLS is the optimizer with the neighbourhood presented in PARTIALCOL . Gitastrophe algorithm ran 10 minutes after which the number of colors no longer decreases. Shadoks algorithm ran for 1 hour without the BDFS option (results with BDFS are worse).\nResults are presented in Table . We only kept the difficult DIMACS instances. For the other instances, all the results match the best known bounds. The DIMACS instances had comparatively few edges (on the order of thousands or millions); the largest intersection graphs considered in the CG:SHOP challenge had over 1.5 billion edges.\nWe notice that the conflict optimizer works extremely poorly on random graphs, but it is fast and appears to perform well on geometric graphs (r250.5, r1000.1c, r1000.5, dsjr500.1c and dsjr500.5), matching the best-known results . Interestingly, these geometric graphs are not intersection graphs as in the CG:SHOP challenge, but are generated based on a distance threshold.\nOn the DIMACS graphs, Lasa implementation shows better performance than the other implementations.",

Many heuristics have been proposed , as well as exact algorithms . We briefly present two classes of algorithms: greedy algorithms and exact algorithms. Greedy algorithms.\nThese algorithms are used to find good quality initial solutions in a short amount of time. The classic greedy heuristic considers the vertices in arbitrary order and colors each vertex with the smallest non-conflicting color. The two most famous modern greedy heuristics are DSATUR and Recursive Largest First (RLF ) .\nAt each step (until all vertices are colored), DSATUR selects the vertex v that has the largest number of different colors in its neighbourhood. Ties are broken by selecting a vertex with maximum degree. The vertex v is colored with the smallest non-conflicting color. RLF searches for a large independent set I, assigns the vertices I the same color, removes I from G , and repeats until all vertices are colored.\nExact algorithms. Some exact methods use a branch-and-bound strategy, for example extending the DSATUR heuristic by allowing it to backtrack . Another type of exact method (branch-and-cut-and-price) decomposes the vertex coloring problem into an iterative resolution of two sub-problems . The \"master problem\" maintains a small set of valid colors using a set-covering formulation.\nThe \"pricing problem\" finds a new valid coloring that is promising by solving a maximum weight independent set problem. Exact algorithms are usually able to find the optimal coloring for graphs with a few hundred vertices. However, even the smallest CG:SHOP 2022 competition instances involve at least a few thousands vertices.\n\nConflict Optimization for Graph Coloring\n\nHenceforth, we will only refer to the intersection conflict graph G induced by the instance. Vertices will refer to the vertices V (G ), and edges will refer to the edges E(G ). Our goal is to partition the vertices using a minimum set of k color classes C = {C 1 , . . . , C k }, where no two vertices in the same color class C i are incident to a common edge.\n\nConflict Optimization",
                "Option (e) The goal of BDFS is to further optimize very good solutions that the conflict optimizer is not able to improve otherwise. Fig. shows the influence of BDFS. While on this figure, the advantages of BDFS cannot be noticed, its use near the end of the challenge improved about 30 solutions. The bounded depth-first search (BDFS) algorithm tries to improve the dequeuing process.\nThe goal is to prevent a vertex in conflict with some adjacent colored vertices from entering in the conflict set. At the first level, the algorithm searches for a recoloring of some adjacent vertices which allows us to directly recolor the conflict vertex. If no solution is found, the algorithm  In both figures the algorithm uses p = 1.2, easy vertices, q max = 59022, but does not use the BDFS nor any clique.\nFor \u03c3 \u2265 0.25, no solution better than 248 colors is found. could recolor some vertices at larger distances from the conflict vertex. To do so, a local search is performed by trying to recolor vertices at a bounded distance from the conflict vertex in the current partial solution. The BDFS algorithm has two parameters: adjacency bound a max and depth d.\nIn order to recolor a vertex v, BDFS gets the set C of color classes with at most a max neighbors of v. If a class in C has no neighbor of v, v is assigned to C. Otherwise, for each class C \u2208 C, BDFS tries to recolor the vertices in C which are adjacent to v by recursively calling itself with depth d \u2212 1.\nAt depth d = 0 the algorithm stops trying to color the vertices. During the challenge the Shadoks used BDFS with parameters a max = 3 and d = 3. The depth was increased to 5 (resp. 7) when the number of vertices in the queue was 2 (resp. 1). Degeneracy order Given a target number of colors k, we call easy vertices a set of vertices Y such that, if the remainder of the vertices of G are colored using k colors, then we are guaranteed to be able to color all vertices of G with k colors.",
                "TABUCOL inspired neighbourhood One classical approach for the vertex coloring involves allowing solutions with conflicting vertices (two adjacent vertices with the same color). It was introduced in 1987 and called TABUCOL. It starts with an initial solution, removes a color (usually the one with the least number of vertices), and assigns uncolored vertices with a new color among the remaining ones.\nThis is likely to lead to some conflicts (i.e. two adjacent vertices sharing a same color). The local search scheme selects a conflicting vertex, and tries to swap its color, choosing the new coloring that minimises the number of conflicts. If it reaches a state with no conflict, it provides a solution with one color less than the initial solution.\nThe process is repeated until the stopping criterion is met. While the original TABUCOL algorithm includes a \"tabu-list\" mechanism to avoid cycling, it is not always sufficient, and requires some hyper-parameter tuning in order to obtain a good performance on a large variety of instances. To overcome this issue, we use a neighbourhood, but replace the \"tabu-list\" by the conflict optimizer scheme presented above.\nPARTIALCOL inspired neighbourhood PARTIALCOL another local search algorithm solving the vertex coloring problem was introduced in 2008. This algorithm proposes a new local search scheme that allows partial coloring (thus allowing uncolored vertices). The goal is to minimize the number of uncolored vertices.\nSimilarly to TABUCOL, PARTIALCOL starts with an initial solution, removes one color (unassigning its vertices), and performs local search iterations until no vertex is left uncolored. When coloring a vertex, the adjacent conflicting vertices are uncolored. Then, the algorithm repeats the process until all vertices are colored, or the stopping criterion is met.\nThis neighbourhood was also introduced alongside a tabu-search procedure. The tabu-search scheme is also replaced by a conflict-optimization scheme. Note that this neighbourhood was predominantly used by the other teams.\n\nFinding Initial Solutions",
                "Results\n\nWe provide the results of the experiments performed with the code from the three teams on two classes of instances. First, we present the results on some selected CG:SHOP 2022 instances. These instances are intersection graphs of line segments. Second, we execute the code on graphs that are not intersection graphs, namely the classic DIMACS graphs , comparing the results of our conflict optimizer implementations to previous solutions.\nThe source code for the three teams is available at: \u2022 Lasa: https://github.com/librallu/dogs-color \u2022 Gitastrophe: https://github.com/jacketsj/cgshop2022-gitastrophe \u2022 Shadoks: https://github.com/gfonsecabr/shadoks-CGSHOP2022\n\nCG:SHOP 2022 Instances\n\nWe selected 14 instances (out of 225) covering the different types of instances given in the CG:SHOP 2022 challenge. The results are presented in Table . For comparison, we executed the HEAD code on some instances using the default parameters. The table shows the smallest number of colors for which HEAD found a solution.\nWe ran HEAD for 1 hour of repetitions for each target number of colors on a single CPU core (the HEAD solver takes the target number of colors as a parameter and we increased this parameter one by one). At the end of the challenge, 8 colorings computed by Lasa, 11 colorings computed by Gitastrophe, and 23 colorings computed by Shadoks over 225 instances have been proved optimal (their number of colors is equal to the size of a clique).\nIn order to compare the efficiency of the algorithms, we executed the different implementations on the CG:SHOP instance vispecn13806. The edge density of this graph is 19%, the largest clique that we found has 177 vertices and the best coloring found during the challenge uses 218 colors. Notice that vispecn13806 is the same instance used in other Shadoks experiments in Section 5. Notice also that HEAD algorithm provides 283 colors after one hour compared to less than 240 colors for the conflict optimizers.\nWe ran the three implementations on three different servers and compared the results shown in Figure . For each implementation, the x coordinate is the running time in hours, while the y coordinate is the smallest number of colors found at that time.",

                "The CG:SHOP challenge (Computational Geometry: Solving Hard Optimization Problems) is an annual geometric optimization competition, whose first edition took place in 2019. The 2022 edition proposed a problem called minimum partition into plane subgraphs. The input is a graph G embedded in the plane with edges drawn as straight line segments, and the goal is to partition the set of edges into a small number of plane graphs (Fig. ) .\nThis goal can be formulated as a vertex coloring problem on a graph G defined as follows. The vertices of G are the segments defining the edges of G, and the edges of G correspond to pairs of crossing segments (segments that intersect only at a common endpoint are not considered crossing). The three top-ranking teams (Lasa, Gitastrophe, and Shadoks) on the CG:SHOP 2022 challenge all used a common approach called conflict optimization while the fourth team used a SAT-Boosted Tabu Search .\nConflict optimization is a technique used by Shadoks to obtain the first place in the CG:SHOP 2021 challenge for low-makespan coordinated motion planning , and the main ideas of the technique lent themselves well to the 2022 challenge. Next, we describe the conflict optimizer as a metaheuristic to solve constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) .\nWe start by describing a CSP. A CSP is a triple of \u2022 variables X = (x 1 , . . . , x n ), Each of the 57 colors is then presented in small figures. \u2022 domains D = (D 1 , . . . , D n ), and \u2022 constraints R. Each variable x i must be assigned a value in the corresponding domain D i such that all constraints are satisfied.\nIn general, the constraints may forbid arbitrary subsets of values. We restrict our attention to a particular type of constraints (binary CSP ), which only involve pairs of assignments. A partial evaluation is an assignment of a subset of the variables, called evaluated, with the remaining variables called non-evaluated.\nAll constraints involving a non-evaluated variable are satisfied by default. We only consider assignments and partial assignments that satisfy all constraints. The conflict optimizer iteratively modifies a partial evaluation with the goal of emptying the set S of non-evaluated variables, at which point it stops.",

                "At each step, a variable x i is removed from S. If there exists a value x \u2208 D i that satisfies all constraints, then we assign the value x to the variable x i . Otherwise, we proceed as follows. For each possible value x \u2208 D i , we consider the set K(i, x) of variables (other than x i ) that are part of constraints violated by the assignment x i = x.\nWe assign to x i the value x that minimizes where w(j) is a weight function to be described later. The variables x j \u2208 K(i, x) become non-evaluated and added to S. The weight function should be such that w(j) increases each time x j is added to S, in order to avoid loops that keep moving the same variables back and forth from S. Let q(j) be the number of times x j became non-evaluated.\nA possible weight function is w(j) = q(j). More generally, we can have w(j) = q(j) p for some exponent p (typically between 1 and 2). Of course, several details of the conflict optimizer are left open. For example, which element to choose from S, whether some random noise should be added to w, and the decision to restart the procedure from scratch after a certain time.\nThe CSP as is, does not apply to optimization problems. However, we can, impose a maximum value k of the objective function in order to obtain a CSP. The conflict optimizer was introduced in a low makespan coordinated motion planning setting. In that setting, the variables are the robots, the domains are their paths (of length at most k) and the constraints forbid collisions between two paths.\nIn the graph coloring setting, the domains are the k colors of the vertices and the constraints forbid adjacent vertices from having the same color. The conflict optimizer can be adapted to non-binary CSP, but in that case multiple variables may be unassigned for a single violated constraint. The strategy has some resemblance to the similarly named min-conflicts algorithm , but notable differences are that a partial evaluation is kept instead of an invalid evaluation and the weight function that changes over time.",
                "In this section, we describe the choices used by the Shadoks team for the options described in Section 2.1. The Shadoks generally chose to eliminate the color with the smallest number of elements. However, if the multistart option is toggled on, then a random color is used each time. The conflict set S is stored in a queue.\nThe Shadoks tried other strategies, but found that the queue gives the best results. The weight function used is w(u) = 1 + q(u) p , mostly with p = 1.2. The effect of the parameter p is shown in Fig. . Notice that in all figures, the number of colors shown is the average of ten executions of the code using different random seeds.\nThe algorithm uses \u03c3 = 0.15, easy vertices, q max = 59022, but does not use the BDFS nor any clique. If q(u) is larger than a threshold q max , the Shadoks set w(u) = \u221e so that the vertex u never reenters S. If at some point an uncolored vertex v is adjacent to some vertex u of infinite weight in every color class, then the conflict optimizer is restarted.\nWhen restarting, the initial coloring is shuffled by moving some vertices from their initial color class to a new one. Looking at Fig. , the value of q max does not seem to have much influence as long as it is not too small. Throughout the challenge the Shadoks almost exclusively used q max = 2000 \u2022 (75000/m) 2 , where m is the number of vertices.\nThis value roughly ensures a restart every few hours. q max =0.5k q max =5k q max =50k q max =100k q max =250k The Shadoks use the function f as a Gaussian random variable of mean 1 and variance \u03c3. A good default value is \u03c3 = 0.15. The effect of the variance is shown in Fig. . Notice that setting \u03c3 = 0 gives much worse results."

                        "The CG:SHOP challenge is an annual geometric optimization competition, with the 2022 edition focusing on the problem of partitioning a graph embedded in the plane into a minimal number of plane subgraphs. This problem can be reformulated as a vertex coloring problem on a graph where vertices represent edges and edges represent crossing segments. The top-ranking teams in the 2022 challenge, including Lasa, Gitastrophe, and Shadoks, employed a common approach called conflict optimization, while the fourth team used a SAT-Boosted Tabu Search. Conflict optimization, a technique that helped Shadoks win the 2021 challenge, is described as a metaheuristic for solving constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). A CSP involves variables, domains, and constraints, with the goal being to assign values to variables that satisfy all constraints. The conflict optimizer iteratively modifies partial evaluations to eventually satisfy all constraints and empty the set of non-evaluated variables.",
                        "The conflict optimizer is a method for solving Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) by iteratively assigning values to variables while minimizing constraint violations. At each step, a variable is removed from a set S and assigned a value from its domain D_i that satisfies all constraints if possible. If no such value exists, the algorithm assigns the value that minimizes a weight function w(j), where j represents variables in constraints violated by the assignment. Variables involved in these violations are marked as non-evaluated and added back to S. The weight function w(j) increases with the number of times a variable j is added to S, preventing loops. The function can be w(j) = q(j) or w(j) = q(j)^p, where q(j) is the count of times j became non-evaluated. The method can be adapted to optimization problems by imposing a maximum objective function value. It was introduced in a makespan-minimizing robot motion planning context and can be applied to graph coloring and non-binary CSPs. The conflict optimizer shares similarities with the min-conflicts algorithm but maintains a partial evaluation and uses a dynamic weight function.",

                        "The text discusses two local search algorithms, TABUCOL and PARTIALCOL, for solving the vertex coloring problem in graph theory. TABUCOL, introduced in 1987, starts with an initial solution, removes a color, and uses a local search to minimize conflicts, repeating until a stopping criterion is met. The original TABUCOL uses a \"tabu-list\" to avoid cycling, but this method requires tuning and is replaced with a conflict optimizer scheme. PARTIALCOL, introduced in 2008, allows partial coloring to minimize uncolored vertices. It also starts with an initial solution, removes a color, and performs local search iterations until no vertex is uncolored, using a conflict-optimization scheme instead of a tabu-search procedure. Both algorithms require an initial solution to begin the process.",
                        "The Lasa team employed two methods to find initial solutions for graph coloring: the classical DSATUR algorithm and an Orientation Greedy algorithm that considers segment geometry. The Orientation Greedy algorithm sorts segments by orientation and assigns colors sequentially, creating new colors if necessary. Meanwhile, the Gitastrophe team used the traditional Welsh-Powell greedy algorithm, experimenting with various orderings but finding no significant difference in color counts after optimization. Both teams modified their conflict optimizers, inspired by memetic algorithms, alternating between conflict minimization and conflict score phases, which led to minor improvements in some challenge instances.",
                        "The Shadoks team's approach involves eliminating the color with the fewest elements, using a random color if the multistart option is on, and storing conflicts in a queue. They found the queue strategy to be most effective. The weight function w(u) = 1 + q(u)\u1d56, typically with p = 1.2, is used, and the impact of p is illustrated. The algorithm employs \u03c3 = 0.15, easy vertices, and q_max = 59022, but avoids BDFS and cliques. If q(u) exceeds q_max, w(u) is set to infinity to prevent reentry. The conflict optimizer restarts if an uncolored vertex is adjacent to vertices of infinite weight in every color class, with initial coloring shuffled. The choice of q_max doesn't significantly affect performance unless it's too small, with the Shadoks using q_max = 2000 \u2022 (75000/m)\u00b2, ensuring restarts every few hours. The function f is a Gaussian random variable with mean 1 and variance \u03c3, with \u03c3 = 0.15 being a good default, though \u03c3 = 0 yields worse results.",
                        "The Bounded Depth-First Search (BDFS) algorithm aims to optimize high-quality solutions that the conflict optimizer cannot further improve. It focuses on improving the dequeuing process by preventing conflict vertices from entering the conflict set. The algorithm attempts to recolor adjacent vertices to resolve conflicts, and if unsuccessful, it performs a local search to recolor vertices at a bounded distance. BDFS has two parameters: adjacency bound (a_max) and depth (d). During the challenge, BDFS was used with a_max = 3 and d = 3, increasing to 5 or 7 when the queue had 2 or 1 vertices, respectively. The algorithm helps ensure that all vertices can be colored with a target number of colors (k) by identifying and handling \"easy vertices.\"",
                        "The process involves using the degeneracy order Y to simplify a graph by iteratively removing vertices with at most k-1 neighbors and appending them to Y. This reduction in vertices enhances the effectiveness of the conflict optimizer.

                "The tribunal found a genuine dispute over whether the claimed \"devices\" and \"two-dimensional rotational transform\" met the criteria for patentable subject matter under the Bilski test. The dispute centered on whether the \"devices\" represented a \"particular machine\" and whether the \"two-dimensional rotational transform\" was a mathematical calculation or a transformation. The ITC concluded that summary judgment on patent eligibility was inappropriate due to these unresolved factual issues.",

Benson. In Ex parte Bodin, a \"computer program product\" was deemed patent-eligible when embodied in a \"computer readable medium.\" The board examined whether \"recorded on the recording medium\" in the claims was equivalent to \"recorded on a computer-readable medium.\" Computer-implemented methods, when properly described as being performed by a computer or its components, remain patentable under Section 101.",
                "The Patent, Trademark & Copyright Journal discusses the application of the Bilski test to determine the eligibility of certain methods under Section 101. The test found that some claims were ineligible because they did not transform physical subject matter or tie the method steps to concrete parts, devices, or combinations of devices. Examples include a method for comparing file tree descriptions and a method for identifying items with symbolic values, both of which were deemed ineligible as they did not involve physical transformations or specific machines. The article highlights that the current scope of patent eligibility varies depending on how methods are described and claimed.",
                "The claim to a data structure must explicitly describe the use of a machine to perform functions, ensuring it is a meaningful limitation on the claim. If a method claim can be read as human-performable, it likely fails the machine prong of Section 101. A claim to a \"computer program product\" with a \"computer usable medium\" is statutory under Section 101 if it refers to tangible storage media. However, a claim reciting \"a computer readable media including program instructions\" was deemed non-statutory in an older decision. There is agreement that a method limited to data transformation is statutory.",
                "The summary of the provided text is as follows:\n\nThe patent eligibility of claims related to computer programs and processes has been significantly impacted by the Bilski decision. Claims that are purely human-performed or lack a concrete real-world application, particularly in areas like financial and legal document processing, are now deemed non-statutory. This has rendered many pending applications and issued patents invalid, causing concern due to the investment involved. The Bilski decision has retroactively affected these patents, despite earlier Federal Circuit rulings suggesting otherwise. Claims must now be more closely tied to tangible results or specific applications to be considered patent-eligible.",
                "The court evaluated patent claims that did not explicitly require a specific machine or apparatus for implementation, focusing on whether the claims met the \"machine\" prong of the Bilski test. It found that the use of a \"comparator\" for pixel-by-pixel comparison, even though defined as a \"device,\" did not mandate a machine, as the function could be performed mentally or on paper. The court also noted that generic computer components were insufficient to satisfy the \"machine\" prong. Regarding the \"transformation\" prong, the court expanded the requirements, emphasizing that the transformation process must be limited to specific data and a visual depiction representing specific objects or subjects.",
                "The text discusses various cases where the board has analyzed patent eligibility under Section 101, particularly focusing on the \"machine\" prong. It highlights that the board has concluded that certain machines, such as classifiers, perform specific data classification functions beyond general computing. This is illustrated in cases like Versata Software Inc. v. Sun Microsystems Inc. and Ex parte Casati, where the board found that transforming an untrained classifier into a trained one or analyzing data to make predictions involved specific machines performing particular functions. The text also mentions less stringent analyses at the board level, as seen in Ex parte Schrader, where a method involving data analysis and prediction was deemed patent-eligible.",

The court found that this did not meet the \"machine-or-transformation\" test under Bilski, as the internet reference was considered \"insignificant extra-solution activity\" and did not render the mental process of data collection and value weighing patent-eligible. The court concluded that the claimed devices could be \"any device\" and did not constitute a particular machine.",

                "The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has interpreted the \"machine\" prong of the Bilski test less strictly than some district courts. In a case involving video game machines and three-dimensional pointing devices, the ITC denied a motion for summary judgment that argued the claims sought to patent a mathematical algorithm. The court assessed whether the method was tied to a specific machine, finding that the recitations of devices like \"3D pointing device\" were insufficient to establish a connection to a particular machine. Instead, these recitations were seen as limiting the field of use of the algorithm rather than adding patentability. The ITC relied on previous cases, such as Ex parte Gutta and Ex parte Nawathe, to support its decision.",
                "The creation of deedshares was insufficient to establish patent eligibility under Bilski. Recent court decisions have invalidated claims involving methods that were deemed obvious over prior art, even when additional steps were added. For example, in King Pharmaceuticals v. Eon Labs, claims for a method to increase oral bioavailability of metaxalone were held invalid as obvious. Similarly, in In re Ferguson, claims for a marketing method were rejected as nonstatutory subject matter because they did not involve a specific machine or transformation. The court emphasized that the added step of informing patients did not meet the Bilski standard, as it did not require a machine or transform the substance.

The court assessed whether the method was tied to a specific machine, finding that the recitations of devices like \"3D pointing device\" were insufficient to establish a connection to a particular machine.

                "Still, more data would be needed to make any conclusive assertions about the exact effect of these environmental parameters on the emerging plasticity mechanisms. A crucial difference between the static and the moving agents is the function the plasticity has to perform. While in the static agents, the plasticity has to effectively identify the exact value distribution of the environment in order to produce accurate predictions, in the embodied agents, the plasticity has to merely produce a representation of the environment that the motor network can evolve to interpret adequately enough to make decisions about which food to consume.\nTo illustrate the difference, we plot the Pearson correlation coefficient between an agent's weights and the ingredient values of the environment it is moving in (Fig. ). We use the correlation instead of the MSE loss (which we used for the static agents in Fig. ) because the amplitude of the vector varies a lot for different agents and meaningful The evolved parameters of moving agents' plasticity rule for the g(s) = x, identity (a.) and the step function (Eq.\n4) (b.) sensory networks (the environmental parameters here are d e \u2208 [0, 1], \u03c3 = 0 and p tr = 0.001). The step function (binary output) network evolved a more structured plasticity rule (e.g., \u03b8 3 > 0 for all realizations) than the linear network. Moreover, the learned weights for the identity network (c.) have higher variance and correlate significantly less with the environment's ingredient distribution compared to the learned weights for the thresholded network (d.)\nconclusions cannot be drawn from the MSE loss. For many agents, the learned weights are consistently anti-correlated with the actual ingredient values (an example of such an agent is shown in Fig. ). This means that the output of the sensory network will have the opposite sign from the actual food value.\nWhile in the static network, this would lead to very bad predictions and high loss, in the foraging task, these agents perform exactly as well as the ones where the weights and ingredients values are positively correlated, since the motor network can simply learn to move towards food for which it gets a negative instead of a positive sensory input.",
                "The evolutionary balance between innate and learned behaviors is highly intricate, and different organisms have found different solutions to this problem. We hypothesize that the emergence and exact form of learning behaviors is naturally connected with the statistics of environmental fluctuations and tasks an organism needs to solve.\nHere, we study how different aspects of simulated environments shape an evolved synaptic plasticity rule in static and moving artificial agents. We demonstrate that environmental fluctuation and uncertainty control the reliance of artificial organisms on plasticity. Interestingly, the form of the emerging plasticity rule is additionally determined by the details of the task the artificial organisms are aiming to solve.\nMoreover, we show that coevolution between static connectivity and interacting plasticity mechanisms in distinct sub-networks changes the function and form of the emerging plasticity rules in embodied agents performing a foraging task. One of the defining features of living organisms is their ability to adapt to their environment and incorporate new information to modify their behavior.\nIt is unclear how the ability to learn first evolved , but its utility appears evident. Natural environments are too complex for all the necessary information to be hardcoded genetically and more importantly, they keep changing during an organism's lifetime in ways that cannot be anticipated ; . The link between learning and environmental uncertainty and fluctuation has been extensively demonstrated in both natural ; , and artificial environments .\nNevertheless, the ability to learn does not come without costs. For the capacity to learn to be beneficial in evolutionary terms, a costly nurturing period is often required, a phenomenon observed in both biological , and artificial organisms . Additionally, it has been shown that in some complex environments, hardcoded behaviors may be superior to learned ones given limits in the agent's lifetime and envi-ronmental uncertainty ; ; .\nThe theoretical investigation of the optimal balance between learned and innate behaviors in natural and artificial systems goes back several decades. However, it has recently found also a wide range of applications in applied AI systems ; . Most AI systems are trained for specific tasks, and have no need for modification after their training has been completed.\nStill, technological advances and the necessity to solve broad families of tasks make discussions about life-like AI systems relevant to a wide range of potential application areas. Thus the idea of open-ended AI agents that can continually interact with and adapt to changing environments has become particularly appealing.",
                "This additional step of the output of the plastic network going through the motor network before producing any behavior has a strong effect on the plasticity rules that the embodied agents evolve. Specifically, if we look at the emerging rules the top performing agents have evolved (Fig. ), it becomes clear that, unlike the very well-structured rules of the static agents (Fig. ), there is now virtually no discernible pattern or structure.\nThe difference becomes even clearer if we look at the learned weights (at the end of a simulation) of the best-performing agents (Fig. ). While there is some correlation with the environment's ingredient value distribution, the variance is very large, and they do not seem to converge on the \"correct\" values in any way.\nThis is to some extent expected since, unlike the static agents where the network's output has to be exactly correct, driving the evolution of rules that converge to the precise environmental distribution, in the embodied networks, the bulk of the processing is done by the motor network which can evolve to interpret the scalar value of the sensory network's output in a variety of ways.\nThus, as long as the sensory network's plasticity rule co-evolves with the motor network, any plasticity rule that learns to produce consistent information about the value of encountered food can potentially be selected. To further test this assumption, we introduce a bottleneck of information propagation between the sensory and motor networks by using a step-function nonlinearity on the output of the sensory network (Eq.\n4). Similarly to the decision task of the static network, the output of the sensory network now becomes binary. This effectively reduces the flow of information from the sensory to the motor network, forcing the sensory network to consistently decide whether food should be consumed (with the caveat that the motor network can still interpret the binary sign in either of two ways, either consuming food marked with 1 or the ones marked with 0 by the sensory network).\nThe agents perform equally well in this variation of the task as before (Fig. ), but now, the evolved plasticity rules seem to be more structured (Fig. ). Moreover, the variance of the learned weights in the bestperforming agents is significantly reduced (Fig. ), which indicates that the bottleneck in the sensory network is in-creasing selection pressure for rules that learn the environment's food distribution accurately.",
                "We first look at the evolved learning rate \u03b7 p , which determines how fast (if at all) the network's weight vector is updated during the lifetime of the agents. We identify three factors that control the learning rate parameter the EA converges to: the distance between the environments, the noisiness of the reward, and the rate of environmental transition.\nThe first natural factor is the distance d e between the two environments, with a larger distance requiring a higher learning rate, Fig. . This is an expected result since the convergence time to the \"correct\" weights is highly dependent on the initial conditions. If an agent is born at a point very close to optimality, which naturally happens if the environments are similar, the distance it needs to traverse on the fitness landscape is small.\nTherefore it can afford to have a small learning rate, which leads to a more stable convergence and is not affected by noise. A second parameter that impacts the learning rate is the variance of the rewards. The reward an agent receives for the plasticity step contains a noise term \u03be that is drawn from a zero mean Gaussian distribution with standard deviation \u03c3.\nThis parameter controls the unreliability of the agent's sensory system, i.e., higher \u03c3 means that the information the agent gets about the value of the foods it consumes cannot be fully trusted to reflect the actual value of the foods. As \u03c3 increases, the learning rate \u03b7 p decreases, which means that the more unreliable an environment becomes, the less an agent relies on plasticity to update its weights, Fig. .\nIndeed for some combinations of relatively small distance d e and high reward variance \u03c3, the EA converges to a learning rate of \u03b7 p \u2248 0. This means that the agent opts to have no adaptation during its lifetime and remain at the mean of the two environments. It is an optimal solution when the expected loss due to ignoring the environmental transitions is, on average, lower than the loss the plastic network will incur by learning via the (often misleading because of the high \u03c3) environmental cues.",
                "Many different approaches for introducing lifelong learning in artificial agents have been proposed. Some of them draw direct inspiration from actual biological systems ; . Among them, the most biologically plausible solution is to equip artificial neural networks with some local neural plasticity , similar to the large variety of synaptic plasticity mechanisms ; ; that performs the bulk of the learning in the brains of living organisms .\nThe artificial plasticity mechanisms can be optimized to modify the connectivity of the artificial neural networks toward solving a particular task. The optimization can use a variety of approaches, most commonly evolutionary computation. The idea of meta-learning or optimizing synaptic plasticity rules to perform specific functions has been recently established as an engineering tool that can compete with stateof-the-art machine learning algorithms on various complex tasks ; ; Pedersen and Risi (2021); .\nAdditionally, it can be used to reverse engineer actual plasticity mechanisms found in biological neural networks and uncover their functions ; . Here, we study the effect that different factors (environ-arXiv:2303.06734v1 [q-bio.NC] 12 Mar 2023 mental fluctuation and reliability, task complexity) have on the form of evolved functional reward-modulated plasticity rules.\nWe investigate the evolution of plasticity rules in static, single-layer simple networks. Then we increase the complexity by switching to moving agents performing a complex foraging task. In both cases, we study the impact of different environmental parameters on the form of the evolved plasticity mechanisms and the interaction of learned and static network connectivity.\nInterestingly, we find that different environmental conditions and different combinations of static and plastic connectivity have a very large impact on the resulting plasticity rules. We imagine an agent who must forage to survive in an environment presenting various types of complex food particles. Each food particle is composed of various amounts and combinations of N ingredients that can have positive (food) or negative (poison) values.\nThe value of a food particle is a weighted sum of its ingredients. To predict the reward value of a given resource, the agent must learn the values of these ingredients by interacting with the environment. The priors could be generated by genetic memory, but the exact values are subject to change. To introduce environmental variability, we stochastically change the values of the ingredients.",
                "Several studies have demonstrated how, in biological networks, synaptic plasticity heavily interacts with and is driven by network topology . Moreover, it has been recently demonstrated that biological plasticity mechanisms are highly redundant in the sense that any observed neural connectivity or recorded activity can be achieved with a variety of distinct, unrelated learning rules .\nThis observed redundancy of learning rules in biological settings complements our results and suggests that the function of plasticity rules cannot be studied independently of the connectivity and topology of the networks they are acting on. The optimization of functional plasticity in neural networks is a promising research direction both as a means to understand biological learning processes and as a tool for building more autonomous artificial systems.\nOur results suggest that reward-modulated plasticity is highly adaptable to different environments and can be incorporated into larger systems that solve complex tasks. This work studies a simplified toy model of neural network learning in stochastic environments. Future work could be built on this basic framework to examine more complex reward distributions and sources of environmental variability.\nMoreover, a greater degree of biological realism could be added by studying more plausible network architectures (multiple plastic layers, recurrent and feedback connections) and more sophisticated plasticity rule parametrizations. Additionally, our foraging simulations were constrained by limited computational resources and were far from exhaustive.\nFurther experiments can investigate environments with different constraints, food distributions, multiple seasons, more complex motor control systems and interactions of those systems with different sensory networks as well as the inclusion of plasticity on the motor parts of the artificial organisms.",

The Pearson correlation coefficient of an evolved agent's weights with the ingredient value vector of the current environment (E 1 -blue, E 2 -red).\nIn this example, the agent's weights are anti-correlated with its environment, which is not an issue for performance since the motor network can interpret the inverted signs of food. The agents can solve the task effectively by evolving a functional motor network and a plasticity rule that converges to interpretable weights (Fig. ).\nAfter \u223c 100 evolutionary steps (Fig. ), the agents can learn the ingredient value distribution using the plastic network and reliably move towards foods with positive values while avoiding the ones with negative values. We compare the dependence of the moving and the static agents on the parameters of the environment: d e and the state transition probability p tr .\nAt first, in order to simplify the experiment, we set the transition probability to 0, but fixed the initial weights to be the average of E 1 and E 2 , while the real state is E 2 . In this experiment, the distance between states d e indicates twice the distance between the agent's initial weights and the optimal weights (the environment's ingredient values) since the agent is initialized at the mean of the two environment distributions.\nSame as for the static agent, the learning rate increases with the distance d e (Fig. ). Then, we examine the effect of the environmental transition probability p tr on the evolved learning rate \u03b7 p . In order for an agent to get sufficient exposure to each environment, we scale down the probability p tr from the equivalent experiment for the static agents.\nWe find that as the probability of transition increases, the evolved learning rate \u03b7 p decreases (Fig. ). This fits with the larger trend for the static agent, although there is a clear difference when it comes to the increase for very small transition probabil-ities that were clearly identifiable in the static but not the moving agents.\nThis could be due to much sparser data and possibly the insufficiently long lifetime of the moving agent (the necessity of scaling makes direct comparisons difficult). Nevertheless, overall we see that the associations observed in the static agents between environmental distance d e and transition probability p tr and the evolved learning rate \u03b7 p are largely maintained in the moving agents.",
                "More precisely, we define two ingredient-value distributions E 1 and E 2 and switch between them, with probability p tr for every time step. We control how (dis)similar the environments are by parametrically setting E 2 = (1 \u2212 2d e )E 1 , with d e \u2208 [0, 1] serving as a distance proxy for the environments; when d e = 0, the environment remains unchanged, and when d e = 1 the value of each ingredient fully reverses when the environmental transition happens.\nFor simplicity, we take values of the ingredients in E 1 equally spaced between -1 and 1 (for the visualization, see Fig. ). The static agent receives passively presented food as a vector of ingredients and can assess its compound value using the linear summation of its sensors with the (learned or evolved) weights, see Fig. .\nThe network consists of N sensory neurons that are projecting to a single post-synaptic neuron. At each time step, an input X t = (x 1 , . . . , x N ) is presented, were the value x i , i \u2208 {1, . . . , N } represents the quantity of the ingredient i. We draw x i independently form a uniform distribution on the [0, 1] interval (x i \u223c U (0, 1)).\nThe value of each ingredient w c i is determined by the environment (E 1 or E 2 ). The postsynaptic neuron outputs a prediction of the food X t value as y t = g(W X T t ). Throughout the paper, g will be either the identity function, in which case the prediction neuron is linear, or a step-function; however, it could be any other nonlinearity, such as a sigmoid or ReLU.\nAfter outputting the prediction, the neuron receives feedback in the form of the real value of the input R t . The real value is computed as R t = W c X T t + \u03be, where W c = (w c 1 , . . . , w c N ) is the actual value of the ingredients, and \u03be is a term summarizing the noise of reward and sensing system \u03be \u223c N (0, \u03c3).",
                "So this learning rule will match the agent's weight vector with the vector of ingredient values in the environment. We examine the robustness of the learning rule the EA discovers by considering a slight modification of our task. Instead of predicting the expected food value, the agent now needs to decide whether to eat the presented food or not.\nThis is done by introducing a step-function nonlinearity (g(x) = 1 if x \u2265 1 and 0 otherwise). Then the output y(t) is computed as: Instead of the MSE loss between prediction and actual value, the fitness of the agent is now defined as the sum of the food values it chose to consume (by giving y t = 1). Besides these two changes, the setup of the experiments remains exactly the same.\nThe qualitative relation between \u03b7 p and parameters of environment d e , \u03c3 and p tr is preserved in the changed experiment. However, the resulting learning rule is significantly different (Fig. ). The evolution converges to the following learning rule: In both cases, the rule has the form \u2206W t = \u03b7 p X t [\u03b1 y R t + \u03b2 y ].\nThus, the \u2206W t is positive or negative depending on whether the reward R t is above or below a threshold (\u03b3 = \u2212\u03b2 y /\u03b1 y ) that depends on the output decision of the network (y t = 0 or 1). Both learning rules (for the reward-prediction and decision tasks) have a clear Hebbian form (coordination of preand post-synaptic activity) and use the incoming reward signal as a threshold.\nThese similarities indicate some common organizing principles of reward-modulated learning rules, but their significant differences highlight the sensitivity of the optimization process to task details. We now turn to the moving embodied agents in the 2D environment. To optimize these agents, both the motor network's connections and the sensory network's plasticity parameters evolve simultaneously.\nSince the motor network is initially random and the agent has to move to find food, the number of interactions an agent experiences in its lifetime can be small, slowing down the learning. However, having the larger motor network also has benefits for evolution because it allows the output of the plastic network to be read out and transformed in different ways, resulting in a broad set of solutions.",

                "A final factor that affects the learning rate the EA will converge to is the frequency of environmental change during an agent's lifetime. Since the environmental change is modeled as a simple, two-state Markov process (Fig. ), the control parameter is the transition probability p tr . When keeping everything else the same, the learning rate rapidly rises as we increase the transition probability from 0, and after reaching a peak, it begins to decline slowly, eventually reaching zero (Fig. ).\nThis means that when environmental transition is very rare, agents opt for a very low learning rate, allowing a slow and stable convergence to an environment-appropriate weight vector that leads to very low losses while the agent remains in that environment. As the rate of environmental transition increases, faster learning is required to speed up convergence in order to exploit the (comparatively shorter) stays in each environment.\nFinally, as the environmental transition becomes too fast, the agents opt for slower or even no learning, which keeps them ) and the decision (b.) tasks, for a variety of parameters (p tr = 0.01, d e \u2208 0, 0.1, . . . , 1, and \u03c3 \u2208 0, 0.1, . . . , 1 in all 100 combinations). Despite the relatively small difference between the tasks, the evolved learning rules differ considerably.\nFor visual guidance, the lines connect \u03b8s from the same run. near the middle of the two environments, ensuring that the average loss of the two environments is minimal (Fig. ). The form of the evolved learning rule depends on the task: Decision vs. Prediction The plasticity parameters \u03b8 = (\u03b8 1 , . . . , \u03b8 8 ) for the rewardprediction task converge on approximately the same point, regardless of the environmental parameters (Fig. ).\nIn particular, \u03b8 3 \u2192 1, \u03b8 5 \u2192 \u22121, \u03b8 i \u2192 0 for all other i, and thus the learning rule converges to: Since by definition y t = g(W t X T t ) = W t X T t (g(x) = x in this experiment) and R t = W c X T t + \u03be we get: Thus the distribution of \u2206W t converges to a distribution with mean 0 and variance depending on \u03b7 p and \u03c3 and W converges to W c .",
                "We find that different sources of variability have a strong impact on the extent to which evolving agents will develop neuronal plasticity mechanisms for adapting to their environment. A diverse environment, a reliable sensory system, and a rate of environmental change that is neither too large nor too small are necessary conditions for an agent to be able to effectively adapt via synaptic plasticity.\nAdditionally, we find that minor variations of the task an agent has to solve or the parametrization of the network can give rise to significantly different plasticity rules. Our results partially extend to embodied artificial agents performing a foraging task. We show that environmental variability also pushes the development of plasticity in such agents.\nStill, in contrast to the static agents, we find that the interaction of a static motor network with a plastic sensory network gives rise to a much greater variety of wellfunctioning learning rules. We propose a potential cause of this degeneracy; as the relatively complex motor network is allowed to read out and process the outputs from the plastic network, any consistent information coming out of these outputs can be potentially interpreted in a behaviorally useful way.\nReducing the information the motor network can extract from the sensory system significantly limits learning rule variability. Our findings on the effect of environmental variability concur with the findings of previous studies that have identified the constraints that environmental variability places on the evolutionary viability of learning behaviors.\nWe extend these findings in a mechanistic model which uses a biologically plausible learning mechanism (synaptic plasticity). We show how a simple evolutionary algorithm can optimize the different parameters of a simple reward-modulated plasticity rule for solving simple prediction and decision tasks.\nReward-modulated plasticity has been extensively studied as a plausible mechanism for credit assignment in the brain ; ; and has found several applications in artificial intelligence and robotics tasks ; . Here, we demonstrate how such rules can be very well-tuned to take into account different environmental parameters and produce optimal behavior in simple systems.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate how the co-evolution of plasticity and static functional connectivity in different subnetworks fundamentally changes the evolutionary pressures on the resulting plasticity rules, allowing for greater diversity in the form of the learning rule and the resulting learned connectivity.",
                "Figure : An outline of the static agent's network. The sensor layer receives inputs representing the quantity of each ingredient of a given food at each time step. The agent computes the prediction of the food's value y t and is then given the true value R t ; it finally uses this information in the plasticity rule to update the weight matrix.\nFor the evolutionary adjustment of the agent's parameters, the loss of the static agent is the sum of the mean squared errors (MSE) between its prediction y t and the reward R t over the lifetime of the agent. The agent's initial weights are set to the average of the two ingredient value distributions, which is the optimal initial value for the case of symmetric switching of environments that we consider here.\nAs a next step, we incorporate the sensory network of static agents into embodied agents that can move around in an environment scattered with food. To this end, we merge the static agent's network with a second, non-plastic motor network that is responsible for controlling the motion of the agent in the environment.\nSpecifically, the original plastic network now provides the agent with information about the value of the nearest food. The embodied agent has additional sensors for the distance from the nearest food, the angle between the current velocity and the nearest food direction, its own velocity, and its own energy level (sum of consumed food values).\nThese inputs are processed by two hidden layers (of 30 and 15 neurons) with tanh activation. The network's outputs are angular and linear acceleration, Fig. . The embodied agents spawn in a 2D space with periodic boundary conditions along with a number of food particles that are selected such that the mean of the food value distribution is \u223c 0. An agent can eat food by approaching it sufficiently closely, and each time a food particle is eaten, it is The sensor layer receives inputs at each time step (the ingredients of the nearest food), which are processed by the plastic layer in the same way as the static sensory network, Fig. .\nThe output of that network is given as input to the motor network, along with the distance d and angle \u03b1 to the nearest food, the current velocity v, and energy E of the agent. These signals are processed through two hidden layers to the final output of motor commands as the linear and angular acceleration of the agent re-spawned with the same value somewhere randomly on the grid (following the setup of ).",
                "After 5000 time steps, the cumulative reward of the agent (the sum of the values of all the food it consumed) is taken as its fitness. During the evolutionary optimization, the parameters for both the motor network (connections) and plastic network (learning rule parameters) are co-evolved, and so agents must simultaneously learn to move and discriminate good/bad food.\nReward-modulated plasticity is one of the most promising explanations for biological credit assignment . In our network, the plasticity rule that updates the weights of the linear sensor network is a rewardmodulated rule which is parameterized as a linear combination of the input, the output, and the reward at each time step:\nAdditionally, after each plasticity step, the weights are normalized by mean subtraction, an important step for the stabilization of Hebbian-like plasticity rules . We use a genetic algorithm to optimize the learning rate \u03b7 p and amplitudes of different terms \u03b8 = (\u03b8 1 , . . . , \u03b8 8 ). The successful plasticity rule after many food presentations must converge to a weight vector that predicts the correct food values (or allows the agent to correctly decide whether to eat a food or avoid it).\nTo have comparable results, we divide \u03b8 = (\u03b8 1 , . . . , \u03b8 8 ) by We then multiply the learning rate \u03b7 p with \u03b8 max to maintain the rule's evolved form unchanged, \u03b7 norm p = \u03b7 p \u2022 \u03b8 max . In the following, we always use normalized \u03b7 p and \u03b8, omitting norm . To evolve the plasticity rule and the moving agents' motor networks, we use a simple genetic algorithm with elitism .\nThe agents' parameters are initialized at random (drawn from a Gaussian distribution), then the sensory network is trained by the plasticity rule and finally, the agents are evaluated. After each generation, the bestperforming agents (top 10 % of the population size) are selected and copied into the next generation.\nThe remaining 90 % of the generation is repopulated with mutated copies of the best-performing agents. We mutate agents by adding independent Gaussian noise (\u03c3 = 0.1) to its parameters. To start with, we consider a static agent whose goal is to identify the value of presented food correctly. The static reward-prediction network quickly evolves the parameters of the learning rule, successfully solving the prediction task."

In static agents, plasticity must accurately identify environmental value distributions for precise predictions, whereas moving agents require a representation that the motor network can interpret to make food consumption decisions. The analysis uses Pearson correlation coefficients between agent weights and ingredient values, avoiding MSE loss due to varying vector amplitudes. The study finds that moving agents with anti-correlated weights perform as effectively as those with positively correlated weights, as the motor network can adapt to negative sensory inputs for food detection.",

It finds that environmental uncertainty and task details shape the reliance on plasticity and the form of the plasticity rules. Coevolution between static and plastic connections in sub-networks further alters these rules, especially in foraging tasks. While learning is crucial for adapting to changing environments, it comes with costs, such as a nurturing period. The balance between innate and learned behaviors is a long-standing theoretical issue, now increasingly relevant in AI, where adaptable, life-like systems are sought for broader applications.",
                "The study examines how the addition of a motor network affects the plasticity rules evolved by embodied agents. Unlike static agents with structured rules, embodied agents exhibit virtually no discernible pattern or structure in their evolved rules. This is partly due to the motor network's ability to interpret sensory network outputs in various ways. To test this, a step-function nonlinearity was introduced, creating a binary output that reduced information flow from the sensory to the motor network. This change led to more structured plasticity rules and reduced variance in learned weights, indicating increased selection pressure for accurate learning of the environment's food distribution.",
                "The learning rate of a network's weight updates is influenced by three main factors: the distance between environments, the noisiness of rewards, and the rate of environmental transition. A larger distance between environments requires a higher learning rate for faster convergence. The variance of rewards, controlled by a noise term, affects the reliability of sensory information; higher noise levels lead to a lower learning rate, as agents become less reliant on plasticity updates. In some cases, the optimal strategy is to have no adaptation, especially when the expected loss from ignoring environmental changes is lower than the loss from learning based on unreliable cues.",

Researchers investigate how different environmental factors, such as fluctuation and reliability, and task complexity, affect the development of these rules.

The findings reveal that environmental conditions and the combination of static and plastic connectivity significantly influence the resulting plasticity rules. The study uses a scenario where an agent must learn to forage in an environment with varying food particles, each composed of different ingredients with positive or negative values, to understand how these factors shape the learning process.",
                "Studies show that synaptic plasticity in biological networks is influenced by network topology and is highly redundant, meaning various learning rules can achieve the same neural connectivity.

Optimizing functional plasticity in neural networks is a promising research direction for understanding biological learning and enhancing artificial systems. Current research uses a simplified model in stochastic environments, suggesting reward-modulated plasticity's adaptability. Future work could explore more complex environments, network architectures, and plasticity rule parametrizations for greater biological realism. Additionally, further experiments could investigate diverse environmental constraints and interactions between motor control and sensory networks.",

Agents evolve to have weights that are anti-correlated with their environment, which is not detrimental to performance due to the motor network's ability to interpret inverted signs. After approximately 100 evolutionary steps, agents can learn the ingredient value distribution and move towards positive-value foods while avoiding negative-value ones. The learning rate increases with the distance between states (d_e) and decreases with the environmental transition probability (p_tr). These associations observed in static agents are largely maintained in moving agents, though differences exist, possibly due to sparse data and shorter lifetimes.",

The environments' similarity is controlled by setting E2 = (1 \u2013 2d_e)E1, where d_e \u2208 [0, 1] is a distance proxy. A static agent assesses food value by summing ingredient quantities with learned weights. The network has N sensory neurons projecting to a single post-synaptic neuron, which predicts the food value using a linear summation or a step function. After prediction, the neuron receives feedback with a real value computed as the weighted sum of ingredients plus noise.",
                "The learning rule developed for an agent to match its weight vector with ingredient values in the environment is tested for robustness by modifying the task. Instead of predicting food value, the agent must decide whether to eat or not, using a step-function nonlinearity. The fitness is now based on the sum of consumed food values. Despite these changes, the learning rule retains a Hebbian form, coordinating pre- and post-synaptic activity and using the reward signal as a threshold. This similarity suggests common principles in reward-modulated learning, though task details significantly impact the optimization process.

As p_tr increases from zero, the learning rate initially rises rapidly, peaks, and then declines slowly, eventually reaching zero. When environmental transitions are rare, agents use a low learning rate for slow, stable convergence to an environment-appropriate weight vector, minimizing losses. As transitions become more frequent, faster learning is needed to adapt quickly to each environment. However, if transitions occur too rapidly, agents may slow or stop learning to maintain stability.

The interaction between static motor networks and plastic sensory networks results in a greater variety of effective learning rules, potentially due to the motor network's ability to interpret consistent sensory information. Reducing sensory information limits learning rule diversity.

The results show that the learning rate of the plastic sensory network increases with the distance between environments and decreases with the frequency of environmental change. The fitness of the agent improves over generations, and the weights of the evolved agent's sensory network exhibit correlations with the environment's ingredient values, which can be interpreted by the motor network for effective foraging.",
                        "The study explores how environmental fluctuations and task complexity influence the evolution of synaptic plasticity rules in artificial agents. It finds that environmental uncertainty and task details shape the reliance on plasticity and the form of the plasticity rules. Coevolution between static and plastic connections in sub-networks further alters these rules, especially in foraging tasks. While learning is crucial for adapting to changing environments, it comes with costs, such as a nurturing period. The balance between innate and learned behaviors is a long-standing theoretical issue, now increasingly relevant in AI, where adaptable, life-like systems are sought for broader applications.",
                        "This study explores the evolution of plasticity rules in artificial neural networks, inspired by biological synaptic plasticity mechanisms. Researchers investigate how different environmental factors, such as fluctuation and reliability, and task complexity, affect the development of these rules. They examine both static, single-layer networks and more complex, moving agents performing foraging tasks. The findings reveal that environmental conditions and the combination of static and plastic connectivity significantly influence the resulting plasticity rules. The study uses a scenario where an agent must learn to forage in an environment with varying food particles, each composed of different ingredients with positive or negative values, to understand how these factors shape the learning process.",
                        "The study defines two ingredient-value distributions, E1 and E2, which switch with a probability p_tr at each time step. The environments' similarity is controlled by setting E2 = (1 \u2013 2d_e)E1, where d_e \u2208 [0, 1] is a distance proxy. A static agent assesses food value by summing ingredient quantities with learned weights. The network has N sensory neurons projecting to a single post-synaptic neuron, which predicts the food value using a linear summation or a step function. After prediction, the neuron receives feedback with a real value computed as the weighted sum of ingredients plus noise.",
                        "The figure outlines the network structure of a static agent that predicts the value of food based on ingredient quantities. The agent updates its weight matrix using a plasticity rule informed by the difference between its prediction and the true value. The agent's parameters are evolved based on the mean squared error (MSE) between its predictions and the actual rewards over its lifetime. The initial weights are set to the average of ingredient value distributions for optimal performance in symmetric environments.\n\nNext, the static agent's network is integrated into an embodied agent capable of movement. This embodied agent combines the static network with a non-plastic motor network to control motion. The embodied agent receives additional sensory inputs such as distance to the nearest food, angle, velocity, and energy level. These inputs are processed through two hidden layers to produce motor commands for linear and angular acceleration. The agents operate in a 2D space with periodic boundary conditions, where they consume food particles that respawn randomly.",
                        "The agent's fitness is determined by its cumulative reward after 5000 time steps, which reflects the total value of food consumed. Both the motor network and plastic network parameters are co-evolved, requiring the agent to learn movement and food discrimination simultaneously. The plasticity rule, which updates the sensor network weights, is a reward-modulated linear combination of input, output, and reward, followed by mean subtraction for stabilization. A genetic algorithm optimizes the learning rate and amplitudes of different terms. The parameters are normalized and evolved using a genetic algorithm with elitism, where the top 10% of agents are selected and copied to the next generation, while the remaining 90% are repopulated with mutated copies. Initial parameters are randomly drawn from a Gaussian distribution, and the sensory network is trained by the plasticity rule. A static agent's reward-prediction network quickly evolves to solve the prediction task.",
                        "The learning rate of a network's weight updates is influenced by three main factors: the distance between environments, the noisiness of rewards, and the rate of environmental transition. A larger distance between environments requires a higher learning rate for faster convergence. The variance of rewards, controlled by a noise term, affects the reliability of sensory information; higher noise levels lead to a lower learning rate, as agents become less reliant on plasticity updates. In some cases, the optimal strategy is to have no adaptation, especially when the expected loss from ignoring environmental changes is lower than the loss from learning based on unreliable cues.",
                        "The learning rate of an evolutionary algorithm (EA) converges to different levels depending on the frequency of environmental changes during an agent's lifetime. This is influenced by the transition probability (p_tr) of a two-state Markov process representing environmental change. As p_tr increases from zero, the learning rate initially rises rapidly, peaks, and then declines slowly, eventually reaching zero. When environmental transitions are rare, agents use a low learning rate for slow, stable convergence to an environment-appropriate weight vector, minimizing losses. As transitions become more frequent, faster learning is needed to adapt quickly to each environment. However, if transitions occur too rapidly, agents may slow or stop learning to maintain stability. The evolved learning rules differ significantly between prediction and decision tasks, with the plasticity parameters converging to specific values that depend on the task and environmental parameters."

Instead of predicting food value, the agent must decide whether to eat or not, using a step-function nonlinearity. The fitness is now based on the sum of consumed food values. Despite these changes, the learning rule retains a Hebbian form, coordinating pre- and post-synaptic activity and using the reward signal as a threshold. This similarity suggests common principles in reward-modulated learning, though task details significantly impact the optimization process. For moving agents in a 2D environment, both motor network connections and sensory network plasticity parameters evolve simultaneously, offering a broad range of solutions despite potential learning slowdowns due to random initial motor networks.",
                        "The fitness of agents, measured by food consumption over their lifetimes, improves over generations in both scalar and binary sensory networks. Agents evolve to have weights that are anti-correlated with their environment, which is not detrimental to performance due to the motor network's ability to interpret inverted signs. After approximately 100 evolutionary steps, agents can learn the ingredient value distribution and move towards positive-value foods while avoiding negative-value ones. The learning rate increases with the distance between states (d_e) and decreases with the environmental transition probability (p_tr). These associations observed in static agents are largely maintained in moving agents, though differences exist, possibly due to sparse data and shorter lifetimes.",
                        "The study explores the impact of environmental parameters on plasticity mechanisms in static and moving agents. In static agents, plasticity must accurately identify environmental value distributions for precise predictions, whereas moving agents require a representation that the motor network can interpret to make food consumption decisions. The analysis uses Pearson correlation coefficients between agent weights and ingredient values, avoiding MSE loss due to varying vector amplitudes. The study finds that moving agents with anti-correlated weights perform as effectively as those with positively correlated weights, as the motor network can adapt to negative sensory inputs for food detection.",
                        "The study examines how the addition of a motor network affects the plasticity rules evolved by embodied agents. Unlike static agents with structured rules, embodied agents exhibit virtually no discernible pattern or structure in their evolved rules. This is partly due to the motor network's ability to interpret sensory network outputs in various ways. To test this, a step-function nonlinearity was introduced, creating a binary output that reduced information flow from the sensory to the motor network. This change led to more structured plasticity rules and reduced variance in learned weights, indicating increased selection pressure for accurate learning of the environment's food distribution.",

Key factors include a diverse environment, reliable sensory systems, and an optimal rate of environmental change. Minor task variations or network parameters can lead to significantly different plasticity rules. Embodied agents performing foraging tasks also exhibit increased plasticity due to environmental variability. The interaction between static motor networks and plastic sensory networks results in a greater variety of effective learning rules, potentially due to the motor network's ability to interpret consistent sensory information. Reducing sensory information limits learning rule diversity. The study extends previous findings on environmental constraints on learning behaviors using a biologically plausible synaptic plasticity model, showing how evolutionary algorithms can optimize reward-modulated plasticity rules for prediction and decision tasks. The co-evolution of plasticity and static connectivity in subnetworks enhances learning rule diversity and learned connectivity.",

This redundancy implies that plasticity rules cannot be studied in isolation from network connectivity. Optimizing functional plasticity in neural networks is a promising research direction for understanding biological learning and enhancing artificial systems. Current research uses a simplified model in stochastic environments, suggesting reward-modulated plasticity's adaptability. Future work could explore more complex environments, network architectures, and plasticity rule parametrizations for greater biological realism.

Physical sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope etc.) signal values change over the movements of the sensor devices. Physiological sensors change over physiological condition of body such as EDA changes over stress and PPG changes over heart rate. However, physical movements also impose noises on physiological sensor signals which is called \\emph{motion artifacts}.\n\\subsubsection{Physiological Signal Processing}",
                "For an ideal IoT-based system, instrumenting and deploying it at each participant's natural living environment warrants for assembling a flexible set of hardware and software interfaces to ease the system configuration, setup, and network discovery processes. The sensor system placed in the residences of volunteers needs to meet several specific physiological signals and activity monitoring needs. However, we must confirm that the devices are reliable with potential for re-deployment as well as appear unintimidating to the participants.

                "EDA is the property of the human body that causes continuous variation in the electrical characteristics of the skin which varies with the state of sweat glands in the skin. There are three types of arousal: \\emph{cognitive, affective and physical}. \\emph{Cognitive} arousal occurs when a person tries to solve any problem using her cognitive ability. \\emph{Affective} arousal occurs when a person is worried, frightened or angry either doing daily activities or in resting position. On the other hand, \\emph{physical} arousal is related to the brain command to move bodily parts which is imposed on the total arousal as an artifact, called \\emph{motion artifact}. However, there are always some noises due to the weather conditions (temperature, humidity etc.) and device motion. This \\emph{motion artifact} can be the prime cause of signal contamination of physiological outcomes while performing daily activities which must be removed. \\emph{AutoCogniSys} proposes an EDA sensor signal processing method consists of three steps: (i) noise and motion artifacts removal, (ii) separation of tonic component and phasic component (explained later) from contamination free EDA signal and (iii) feature extraction on the response window.\n\\subsubsection{Motion Artifacts Removal}\nThere are many types of motion artifacts but the unsual steep rise is the mostly occured ones associated with EDA signal while performing daily activities \\cite{edel67}. We use well-known steep rising noises reduction technique, SWT \\cite{chen15}. We first consider EDA signal as a mixture of a slow variant tonic and fast variant phasic component, i.e., SWT coefficient is modeled as a mixture of two Gaussian components, phasic (close to zero valued signal) and tonic (high rising signal). After expanding EDA signal into multiple levels of scaling and wavelet coefficients, we choose adaptively a threshold limit at each level based on the statistical estimation of the wavelet coefficients' distribution, and employ that on the wavelet coefficients of all levels. Finally, an inverse wavelet transform technique is applied to the thresholded wavelet coefficients to obtain the artifacts free EDA signal. Fig~.\\ref{fig:eda_artifact_removal} shows a sample of raw and motion artifacts free EDA signal.",

Participants are instructed to perform the complex activities while the trained evaluator observed the aforementioned functional activity performance measures. Each incorrect attempt of performance measure will be assigned one point thus higher score reflects lower performance of functional activities \\cite{dawadi14}. We first detect hand gesture and postural activities. Then, we feed the low-level activity contexts (gestural and postural) combined with ambient contexts (object and ambient motion sensor readings) into HDBN for single inhabitant model \\cite{alam16b} to recognize complex activities. The complex activity recognition framework provides both activity labels and activity window (start-end points). Then, we extract features of object sensor, ambient sensor, gestural activity and postural activity events for each activity window. The features are number of occurrences, mean number of occurrences, consecutive 1, 2, 3, $\\ldots$ 20 occurrences, top 10, 20, 30, $\\ldots$, 90 percentile etc (29 features in total). In \\emph{physiological features} we first detect 13 complex activities using HDBN algorithm which provides activity labels and activity window (start-end points), apply noise reduction, motion artifacts removal, extract 7 EDA features and 8 HRV features for each activity and take the mean of them over time (minutes) to get 15 (7+8) complex activity physiological features set for each participant.

The method comprises of the following steps: (i) \\emph{Preprocessing:} wrist-worn ACC sensor provided 3-axis data are passed through 0.4Hz low-pass filter to remove the data drift. (ii) \\emph{Rotation normalization:} Normalizing the rotation of hand gestures provides greater accuracy and allows for more realistic, orientation-independent motion. At first, we find the best fit plane of the acceleration vectors thus if the motion lies in a single plane, then the acceleration vectors of a closed shape should on average lie in that main plane. Then, we take all acceleration segments between points of inflection to form one single vector called reference vector that provides us the general direction of user's motion. After that, each vector is normalized relative to the reference vector. This normalization helps remove a lot of hand gestures from prior considered 18 hand gestures resulting a reduced dictionary of 8 gestures. (iii) \\emph{Feature Weighted Naive Bayesian model:} Naive Bayes classifier is light-weight and efficient technique for hand gesture recognition. We extract 12 ACC features \\cite{alam17} and calculate weight for each feature type based on the similarity of feature measures of the trained gestures (0$<$weight$<$1). While recognizing gestures, the proximity of each feature measure to the average trained feature measure of each gesture type is calculated by a normal distribution. Then, the proximity value is multiplied by the feature weight that was calculated in the training phase.  All of these multiplied values are added together and the system predicts the gesture type with the greatest value as the user gesture. In the learning data points, there should be static postural activities (such as sitting, lying etc.) to avoid unexpected noises over wrist-worn ACC sensors. In the final hand gesture dictionary, we save the reference vector as our signal dictionary.\n\\subsection{Postural Activity Recognition}",

Though, Alam et. al. provides significant performance improvement for single wrist-worn ACC sensor aided 18-hand gesture based postural activity recognition in lab environment \\cite{alam17}, it faces some practical challenges in real-time smart environment with older adults due to the diversity of their postures. For example, some older adults use walker, double walking sticks or wheel chair for walking in which cases collecting 18 hand gestures and corresponding postural activities for training requires endless efforts and carefulness. To reduce the complexity of ground truth labeling and later state space explosion for graphical model (HDBN), we propose to use rotational normalization method that can merge some hand-gestures subject to directional differences and forms an 8-hand gesture model.

Approximately 5.2 million people of 65 and older are suffered with any form of cognitive impairments in United States in 2012 \\cite{stat12}. Dementia is one of the major causes of the cognitive impairments which is more acute among 85 and older population (50\\%) \\cite{stat12}. However, the costs (financial and time) of health care and long-term care for individuals with Alzheimer's (special form of dementia) or other dementias are substantial. For example, during 2016, about 15.9 million family and friends in United States provided 18.2 billion hours of unpaid assistance to those with cognitive impairments which is a contribution to the nation valued at \\$230.1 billion. One the other hand, total payments for all individuals with all form of cognitive impairments are estimated at \\$259 billion. Total annual payments for health care, long-term care and hospice care for people with Alzheimer's or other dementias are projected to increase from \\$259 billion in 2017 to more than \\$1.1 trillion in 2050. Among the above costs, a significant amount are relevant to clinical and diagnostic tests \\cite{stat17}. Although clinical and diagnostic tests have become more precise in identifying dementia, studies have shown that there is a high degree of underrecognition especially in early detection. However, there are many advantages to obtaining an early and accurate diagnosis when cognitive symptoms are first noticed as the root cause findings of impairment always lessen the progress of impairment status and sometimes symptoms can be reversible and cured.",

I know paying using the property taxes was bandied about. The argument against it was it would mean some would be paying for water they aren\u2019t using and others could be big water users, but pay a small special assessment on their property taxes. I think the decision that was made to base it on usage was out of fairness. It seems to me if people are using water and not paying their share of the costs it is not fair. The Senior issue is very difficult. If someone is retired for twenty years is it realistic to think prices don\u2019t go up during the 20 years of retirement. Think what prices were in 1990 compared to today. Should Seniors never have to pay for capital improvements? Paso Robles also had very low water rates. Rates that are no longer possible given the circumstances. Desalination will happen eventually. California is out of water. If you want to pay $1,000,000 a gallon there is no more allotable water of any consequence in California. The expense will be tremendous \u2014 still have to build a desalination plant, still have to build a pipeline. I don\u2019t know if the plant has to be built along the ocean or if the salt water could be piped over to Paso Robles. If it has to be built along the ocean, Paso Robles doesn\u2019t own land on the ocean and, in any case, the environmentalists will keep it in courts for years as they have done so for other proposed desalination plants in Southern California.

The rate increase is being hung up in the courts by the City Attorney. What was supposed to be a quick issue to get in front of a judge, has been drug out as long as possible by the City Attorney.\nEven if the courts throw out the current rate increase, I expect that our civil servants will just change a couple of words in the rate increase notice and force the same old plan on us again.\nThere is a real problem with the people we have hired to work for us in Paso Robles.

The forecast\nshows that if local plans are not changed, demand for\nhousing will continue to outpace the supply, just as\nHousing element law addresses this problem directly by\nrequiring cities and counties to zone land at appropriate\ndensities to accommodate the projected housing needs of all\nincome groups and to remove constraints that prevent such\nsites from being developed at the allowed densities. AB 602\nCities and counties, however, are not required to build\nhousing because that is the role of private developers.\nThe law holds cities and counties accountable only for that\nwhich they control: zoning and land use entitlements.\nWithout the ability to enforce housing element law, the\nmarket\u2019s ability to meet housing demand may well remain\nlocked up.\nFISCAL EFFECT : Appropriation: No Fiscal Com.: No\nSUPPORT : (Verified 8/23/10)\nCalifornia Rural Legal Assistance Foundation (co-source)\nHousing California (co-source)\nAdvocates for Affordable Homes in Fremont\nCalifornia Coalition for Rural Housing\nCommunity Housing Improvement Program\nCommunity Housing Works\nEden Housing\nFair Housing of Marin\nGrassroots Leadership Network of Marin\nKennedy Commission\nPublic Advocates, Inc\nSan Diego Housing Federation\nSelf-Help Enterprises\nSierra Club of California\nAmerican Planning Association, California Chapter",

It\u2019s almost like dealing with some City officials. They just let the public vent at their bimonthly council meetings. In my opinion, it\u2019s difficult to deal with narcissism and arrogance. Over the years, there has been some very good input to our elected officials on how to proceed on the Nacimiento water pipeline,but it fell on deaf ears. You wanted me to answer some of your questions,but you did not answer some of my questions. Again, are you willing to subsidize new development?,Yes?or No?, are you willing to pay for a commodity that you are not receiving? Yes?or No? and another question for you. Are you willing to pay over 300% on your water bills within the five (5) year plan that the City has proposed? Also, the water rates will be subject to later increases too. By the way, I do concur with the city\u2019s plan of \u201cyou pay for the amount of water units you use\u201d. (748 gal=one unit). However, the higher water rates are not good for our senior citizens on fixed incomes and other struggling families in our community. My first suggestion years ago was desalination. The response was it was too expensive. Of course, now it is more expensive. I would suggest that our elected officials recall the existing bonds (The bonds can be recalled early). The City council can explain to the citizens in detail with financing of new bonds at a lower interest rate as of now for the sewer plant and Nacimiento water pipeline and present their new proposal in compliance with Proposition 218. Let the citizens of Paso VOTE on the financing bonds for their approval. Most of the citizens,that I had spoken to were not happy with the way our City Council handled the Nacimiento water pipeline project. The citizens of Paso didn\u2019t give our City Council a \u201cBLANK CHECK\u201d for $176 million to spend without voter approval. I would suggest that it be a \u201cspecial tax\u201d or \u201can assessment\u201d be levied on our property taxes. A percentage of those bonds can be deducted on Federal Income taxes.

Pretty clear.\nYour idea of charging based on a special assesment rather than the amount of water a property uses means that people who use little water, but live on a more expensive property will pay more than their share, based on their water usage. In addition, how do you deal with a rental unit where the renter is supposed to pay the water bill? Your idea is inherantly unfair, but my guess is it will favor you, so you don\u2019t care if it is unfair and other people would pay part of your share. You also have decided that since I have alternative ideas to yours I must work for, or have business with the City of Paso Robles, another attempt to deflect from the issue.

                        "In Paso Robles, citizens voted down a water rate increase, but the City Attorney has delayed the issue in court. Despite potential court rejection, officials may reintroduce the same plan with minor changes. The City Council recently hired a law firm linked to corruption in Bell, California, raising concerns about the council's priorities and alignment with citizens' interests. The author argues that elected officials have lost sight of their role in serving the community, focusing instead on personal agendas.",
                        "The upcoming November election presents an opportunity to elect responsible and principled representatives in Paso Robles. The author emphasizes the importance of choosing candidates who will lawfully represent citizens and bring about significant changes, rather than maintaining the current governance. The community has previously united to make impactful decisions, and the author urges citizens to vote for a democratic governing body to replace the existing leadership. Jim Reed, a longtime resident, supports this call for change.",
                        "Governments must determine regional housing needs two years before scheduled revisions, with councils of governments or the department allocating housing needs to cities and counties one year before revisions. Extensions of up to 60 days may be granted for access to recent census data. The allocation plan aims to increase housing supply, promote infill development, and ensure equitable distribution of housing units, particularly for low- and very low-income households. It also considers existing income distributions within jurisdictions.",
                        "The department determines income levels based on the most recent decennial census, categorizing them into very low, lower, moderate, and above moderate incomes according to specific sections of the Health and Safety Code. These determinations, made by the department, councils of governments, or cities/counties, are exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act.",

They criticize the blogger for being evasive and rhetorical in responses, and for taking their questions out of context. The author also questions the blogger's knowledge of local water unit costs and suggests they educate themselves on California Housing Element Laws.",

They accuse WhatIsUp of being biased towards city decisions and possibly having connections to the city. The sender also questions WhatIsUp's stance on who doesn't pay their fair share for water, specifically mentioning wineries. They conclude by asking about the cost of water usage in Templeton compared to Paso Robles, noting that Templeton is under county jurisdiction.",

They question whether residents would object to financing new bonds through property taxes, comparing it to the practice of funding local school bonds without having children in school. The speaker emphasizes the importance of addressing water usage by wineries, which are located in the county and not under the city's jurisdiction, suggesting that complaints should be directed to Sacramento. They imply that some residents may oppose the infrastructure project due to reluctance to pay for it.",

They criticize the idea of charging based on property value rather than water usage, arguing it is unfair and could disproportionately affect those with expensive properties but low water usage. The individual denies working for or having business with the city, owning property there instead. They mention the need for a fix to housing element laws due to a lawsuit, suggesting this should inform understanding of California's housing element laws. The provided bill analysis (AB 602) is related to these laws, indicating a legislative effort to address housing issues.",

City of Pleasanton (2008) case, regarding the statute of limitations and remedies for housing-related challenges. The Planning and Zoning Law mandates cities and counties to prepare and adopt housing elements every five or eight years, depending on their location, to guide community growth. These elements must identify and analyze housing needs, suitable sites, and regulatory systems to meet regional housing needs assessments (RHNA). The bill seeks to clarify and revise the statute of limitations and remedies for such housing-related challenges.",
                        "The summary outlines various housing-related laws and regulations, including:\n\n1. **Ordinance Limiting Housing Units**: An ordinance that restricts the annual number of housing units to justify public health, safety, and welfare benefits, potentially reducing housing opportunities.\n\n2. **Density Bonus Law**: Requires cities and counties to grant developers density bonuses, incentives, and concessions for including affordable housing in their projects.\n\n3. **Least Cost Zoning Law (AB 602)**: Mandates cities and counties to designate and zone sufficient vacant land for residential use at the lowest possible cost to meet housing needs for all income levels.\n\n4. **Tentative Subdivision Map Approval**: Requires cities and counties to apply only current ordinances, policies, and standards when approving tentative subdivision maps.\n\n5. **Challenging Housing Element Adequacy**: Prior to a recent court decision, parties could challenge a city or county's housing element at any time during a planning period if it hindered affordable housing development. The process involved serving a notice identifying deficiencies, with a 60-day response period and a one-year statute of limitations for legal action.\n\n6. **Urban Habitat Program v. City of Pleasanton (2008)**: A case where Urban Habitat Program challenged Pleasanton's housing policies, including caps on housing permits and total units, claiming they were insufficient to meet RHNA obligations. The First District California Court of Appeals allowed the case to proceed."

This limits the time frame for such challenges during the planning period. The bill removes project-specific actions from the list of challenges under Government Code 65009, but maintains the ability to challenge the adequacy of a city\u2019s or county\u2019s density bonus ordinance. It also extends the time for serving a deficiency notice to all remaining city or county actions, including those related to affordable housing, allowing up to five years for such notices.",

                        "The court's interpretation of statutory language, added by AB 998 (Waters) in 1983, allows a housing element to be deemed in compliance if it substantially meets housing element law requirements. This law, sponsored by the League of California Cities and the California Building Industry Association, created a statute of limitations for land use decisions but included an exception for challenging deficient housing elements. Housing advocates have successfully used this provision, sending deficiency notices even after 90 days post-adoption, without contest. However, as of June 2010, only 46% of cities and counties had adopted HCD-approved housing elements for the current planning period, highlighting the need for better compliance to support private housing market opportunities.",
                        "The San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) highlights a California paradox where current land use plans fail to accommodate projected population growth. Despite a 37% population increase by 2030, housing is only expected to grow by 30%, leading to a supply-demand imbalance. Housing element law requires cities and counties to zone land appropriately for all income groups, but enforcement is limited to zoning and land use entitlements, not actual housing construction. Without stronger enforcement, the market may struggle to meet housing demand.",

                        "The author expresses dissatisfaction with the response to their comments, comparing it to dealing with city officials who ignore public input. They question whether the responder is willing to subsidize new development, pay for a non-received commodity, and accept a 300% increase in water bills over five years. The author suggests recalling existing bonds and financing new ones at lower interest rates, proposing a vote on bond financing for the Nacimiento water pipeline. They argue that the current handling of the project by the city council has not been transparent and that citizens should have a say in the financing. The author also highlights concerns about the impact of higher water rates on senior citizens and struggling families.",
                        "The author suggests that homeowners should consider paying a deductible for insurance, likening it to receiving a return on a \"special tax\" or \"assessment\" rather than nothing on a \"fee.\" However, some homeowners may be hesitant due to the current poor economy.",
                        "The discussion revolves around the necessity of subsidizing new water development in California, with concerns about fairness in funding and the impact on senior citizens. The current system bases costs on water usage, which some argue is fair, but others believe property taxes could be a more equitable solution. The issue of rising costs for seniors is also debated, as well as the inevitability of desalination due to California's water scarcity. The public's lack of support for the current expensive and limited benefit project further complicates the situation.",
                        "The discussion about the water issue highlights concerns over how the plan should be financed and whether elected officials and unelected authorities are following or ignoring laws. Examples include a city official suggesting citizens sue if they disagree with the plan, a city attorney refusing to answer questions, and the council reintroducing a project after it was voted down by citizens. These actions suggest that current representatives are not effectively serving the citizens. The original post argues for electing different representation, a view supported by the ongoing conversations."

                "Citations: The Message of the Psalms and Praying the Psalms by Walter Brueggemann and Getting Involved with God, by Ellen Davis.\nJoseph\u2019s story opens in Genesis 37 and it\u2019s a long one. Joseph was one of 11 kids, the youngest son. In Genesis 37, the story says, \u201cNow Jacob (Joseph\u2019s dad) loved Joseph more than any of his other sons because he was born when Jacob was old. Jacob had made for him a long robe. When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of his brothers, they hated him and couldn\u2019t even talk nicely to him.\u201d Sibling rivalry, jealousy, family drama\u2014maybe a little too familiar for some of us.\nJust when you want to feel bad for Joseph, show him sympathy, \u201cPoor kid\u2014he can\u2019t help that he\u2019s the favorite,\u201d Joseph makes himself quickly unlikeable. When Joseph\u2019s head hits the pillow at night, he has vivid dreams about the future, dreams where he rules over his brothers. In one of these dreams, he\u2019s in the field working with his brothers. They each tie a bundle of grain together\u2026I imagine it like a hay bail. His bail rises up, towering and floating in the air above the others, while each of his ten older brother\u2019s bails of hay, bows down to his bail, as if he\u2019s ruling over them like a king. What\u2019s worse\u2014he didn\u2019t keep his mouth shut about his dreams. Nope. He went ahead and announced them at the dinner table. When I imagine this scene, I\u2019m reminded of the importance of friends. He seriously needed a friend to say, \u201cDude, listen, you have some dreams where you\u2019re awesome and your brothers treat you like a king. They hate you, man. Keep your dreams to yourself.\u201d Joseph lacked such a friend, so he bragged about his dreams\u2014that combined with his fancy North Face jacket that Daddy bought for him only and the favoritism their dad showed him, brought his brothers to plot about how they might rid themselves of this pesky brat forever.",
                "\u201cBlessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted,\u201d Jesus proclaims in the second line of the beatitudes. Blessed are those who mourn. How is this weeping woman, this victim of abuse, blessed? She mourns the injustices she\u2019s experienced, her suffering, the ways her life has been shaped by pain and her inability to free herself from her oppression. Jesus says that this woman and all her sisters and brothers that mourn with her are blessed.\nThe Jewish culture that Jesus was born into has a rich history of mourning or practicing lament, stretching back hundreds of years before he was born. The prophets and the Psalms include poems, songs, and speeches, recounting the words of people gathered together for public mourning. This mourning wasn\u2019t a kind of crying about having a bad day or because of a frustration at home or work. The mourning Jesus is referencing is the kind of mourning that is a response to injustice and oppression, those who mourn the impact of the powers, both material and spiritual, on the lives of the most vulnerable.\nBlessed are those who mourn. Another beatitude and another paradox. Once again, Jesus\u2019 words are outlandish and nonsensical. How is it that those who mourn are blessed? Aren\u2019t those who are happy and fulfilled, aren\u2019t they the ones that are blessed? Yet, in this beatitude, in this paradox, Jesus once again exposes the powers and envisions an alternative. Jesus exposes the powers that cause people to mourn in the first place, those who experience unjust suffering and loss, the same injustices that cause people to be poor in spirit. It\u2019s these people, the mourners, that are blessed, Jesus says. These are the people that Jesus came for. In God\u2019s empire, mourners are not written off or ignored as uncivilized, uneducated, or badly behaved. Instead, in God\u2019s empire, they are the ones who receive God\u2019s comfort and consolation; God\u2019s hears their cries.",
                "Fear not only keeps them from confession, fear also keeps them from receiving forgiveness. They are scared for their lives the moment their father breathes his last, but haven\u2019t they already been through this conversation with Joseph? At the dinner table, when Joseph revealed his identity to them, he tells them not to worry. \u201cIt\u2019s ok. Yeah, it was awful, but look where I am! Look at how God has used me to help save those who would be starving now. I\u2019m even saving you!\u201d Joseph has already offered them forgiveness, but they haven\u2019t fully received it. They haven\u2019t believed what he\u2019s said. Perhaps their views of themselves were so low that they didn\u2019t see themselves worthy of forgiveness. Maybe they\u2019ve carried the guilt for so long about what they\u2019ve done, they fear what life will be like without it. It\u2019s become so much an engrained part of their identity, they don\u2019t know who they are apart from the guilt of what they\u2019ve done. They fear receiving Joseph\u2019s forgiveness. They fear forgiving themselves.\nTo the plea of the 10 brothers, to this made-up, manipulative, last cry for safety, Joseph has two responses. First, he weeps. His weeping\u2014his display of vulnerability and emotion\u2014causes his brothers to begin to weep also. There they are, 11 grown brothers, weeping on the floor of the house. Why did Joseph begin to weep? The story doesn\u2019t say. Let\u2019s notice, brothers and sisters\u2014the road to releasing fear and offering and receiving forgiveness may not come without weeping.",
                "Realizing that their father was dead, Joseph\u2019s brothers said, \u201cWhat if Joseph still bears a grudge against us and pays us back in full for all the wrong that we did to him?\u201d 16 So they approached[b] Joseph, saying, \u201cYour father gave this instruction before he died, 17 \u2018Say to Joseph: I beg you, forgive the crime of your brothers and the wrong they did in harming you.\u2019 Now therefore please forgive the crime of the servants of the God of your father.\u201d Joseph wept when they spoke to him. 18 Then his brothers also wept,[c] fell down before him, and said, \u201cWe are here as your slaves.\u201d 19 But Joseph said to them, \u201cDo not be afraid! Am I in the place of God? 20 Even though you intended to do harm to me, God intended it for good, in order to preserve a numerous people, as he is doing today. 21 So have no fear; I myself will provide for you and your little ones.\u201d In this way he reassured them, speaking kindly to them.\nFear is a powerful force. Fear motivates and fear paralyzes.\nIt\u2019s a little funny how they phrase the words of their father. The brothers put a great deal of distance between themselves and Joseph. Instead of saying, \u201cOur father told us to tell you\u2026\u201d they say, \u201cYour father to us to tell you\u2026\u201d They distance themselves from Joseph and from the message that their dad supposedly gave them to pass along.\nAnd then, they do it again. \u201cPlease forgive the crime of the servants of the God of your father,\u201d his brothers say. They refer to themselves in third person\u2014\u201cthe servants of the God of your father.\u201d It\u2019s not \u201cour crime\u201d that \u201cwe committed,\u201d but the crime of these others.",
                "Our culture tends to restrict mourning or public displays of emotion to something appropriate for home life or private time. Further, spending time in mourning may be quickly relegated to a waste of time or an inactive posture. The expression, \u201cDon\u2019t just cry about it, do something,\u201d illustrates this clearly. But mourning is not a useless waste of time or an inactive practice. Mourn is a verb. In fact, mourning elicits action and engagement. Mourning exposes the powers, shows their true colors. Seeing people in mourning is disorienting. It interrupts the lives we lead that are detached from suffering and injustice, forcing us to take another look, to pause, to listen, and to join.\nThe woman who interrupted our solemn vigil for victims of domestic violence exposed the powers with her loud wailing. She made me feel uncomfortable, like I wanted to look away and get away from her as quickly as possible. And yet, her cries made it impossible for me to forget her. The sound of her weeping echoed in my ears for weeks following and if I try, I can still hear them now, over nine months later. Her mourning moves me to engage in seeking justice for others who have suffered like she has.\n1. James Howell, The Beatitudes for Today. Louisville: Westminster John Knox Press, 2005., 45.\n2.

                "It doesn\u2019t take long, does it. By the end of this sermon, I will no doubt feel thirsty, not from walking on hard dusty ground in the heat of the day, but just from speaking with you. Most of us wake up in the morning needing a drink. Our bodies depend on water. We cannot live without it. Thirst, then, doesn\u2019t happen only one time. When the Israelites panicked that they had no water, they weren\u2019t only thinking of the present moment. They knew what was coming! We need water to live! Without water, we will die! Even if we have water for today, we will need water again tomorrow! We can drink until we are satisfied, only to know that we will eventually be thirsty for more.\nThe gospel of John tells a story about a woman who gave up on this question all together. She moved beyond wondering if the Lord was really with her, so confident God had forgotten her that she gave up wondering at all. Born a Samaritan into a world that valued other bodies as better than her body: male bodies, Jewish bodies, even married bodies. Even after encountering Jesus, she still leaves their conversation without a name, numbered as one of many, simply called, \u201cSamaritan woman.\u201d She too, was thirsty. Most believe that her shame led her to drink water in the heat of the day, when no one else would be at the rocky well, when she could get a drink alone, without experiencing the stigma and stares of others. When she came to get a drink, Jesus was also at the well, thirsty himself and in need of rest and water from the long journey through Samaria.\nThe Israelites complaint for water sends Moses to the only one who can satisfy, the only one who can meet this need. Moses turns to God, \u201cWhat should I do with these people? How can I satisfy their thirst? I\u2019ve looked around, I\u2019ve checked far and wide, turned the house upsidedown, looked under the seats of the car, at the bottle of every bottle, I\u2019ve even looked for dew on the ground and under the lids of jars and there is no water to be found. Where do we go for water? Is the Lord really with us or not?",
                "Almost immediately, the path presents itself as a linear and chronological symbol of my life\u2019s journey. Like my physical lifetime, it has a beginning and an end, with an as\u2010yet undetermined amount between. This could be interesting. I like it so far\u2026 although I\u2019m insecure about my style\u2026 and unsure about proper protocol. Is someone staring at me? Do I have to meditate? How slowly should I walk? Is it better to focus my thoughts\u2026 or to simply let them come? Will I control this thing, or allow it to control me?\nI begin to see each step as an increment of elapsed time, an irretrievable expenditure of life energy. I equate my initial discomfort to the natural immaturity of my childhood years. I gradually move beyond it, into metaphorical adulthood. This is much better.\nMost of the path is a series of gentle arcs. These are fairly easy to maneuver, like my comfortable life. But these segments are connected by intermittent sharp turns, mostly 180\u2010degree switchbacks. I see these as representing significant life changes or challenges, requiring more concentration and skill to negotiate. I notice that I am executing some of these turns mechanically, and some more gracefully. I begin to anticipate upcoming turns, and try to maintain good form around each one.\nI can\u2019t see much of the path ahead, nor the end. I spend a significant amount of mental energy dealing with this uncertainty, constantly wanting to know my real\u2010time ratio of \u201cdistance walked\u201d to \u201cdistance remaining\u201d. This is a recurring distraction.\nToday is Father\u2019s Day, and my Dad is on my mind. He recently completed his well\u2010walked journey, and is now watching me\u2026 even if as mere metaphor\u2026 or only as an element of my own (self\u2010) consciousness. I feel his presence embedded in his absence. I\u2019m aware that it\u2019s not only my turn to walk\u2026 it\u2019s my only turn to walk.\nI think about my children, grandson, soon\u2010to\u2010arrive granddaughter, and their descendants. The familiar succession of life, death and new life seems magical, divinely\u2010derived, and strangely better than living forever. My role is limited, but critical. I love the part, and embrace it.",
                "I am acutely aware that others are journeying all around me. These are friends of mine. We meet, almost brushing, as we walk. The path seems purposefully narrow, perhaps perfectly so. I suddenly understand that it is impossible to walk this close to others without being affected by them. I affect them too\u2026 seen as small adjustments in their position or posture. As we meet, I try not to encroach too much, but making sure not to pull away. I put creative energy into maintaining the perfect degree of separation between our bodies. This feels like more art than science\u2026 each friend deserving a customized approach. This closeness seems good to me.\nThere is a much younger walker behind me, getting ever closer. I\u2019m clearly holding her back. Maybe this means that the younger generation wants me to hurry up and get out of their way. I remind myself not to stretch the symbolism too far\u2026 as I pick up my pace.\nI now see the end of the path ahead. I have been expecting this part to be emotionally complicated, but it is not. The final section is round\u2026 large and unrestrictive\u2026 a qualitative change from the narrow linear pathway. The circle opens up to welcome me. It is easy to step into, a perfectly natural thing to do at the end of my walk. Inside the circle, I am centered\u2026 comfortable\u2026 peaceful\u2026 thankful.\n16 As Jesus passed alongside the Galilee Sea, he saw two brothers, Simon and Andrew, throwing fishing nets into the sea, for they were fishermen. 17 \u201cCome, follow me,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019ll show you how to fish for people.\u201d 18 Right away, they left their nets and followed him. 19 After going a little farther, he saw James and John, Zebedee\u2019s sons, in their boat repairing the fishing nets. 20 At that very moment he called them. They followed him, leaving their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired workers.",
                "Joseph\u2019s brothers considered killing Joseph, but they settled on kidnapping him and selling him into slavery instead. That way, they wouldn\u2019t have his death on their foreheads, without having to put up with him anymore. They took Joseph\u2019s fancy coat and destroyed it, making it look like a wild animal killed Joseph. This they showed to their father, so that he would assume that Joseph was dead; their dad would never suspect they had any part in his disappearance.\nMeanwhile, Joseph was taken off to Egypt where he worked as a slave. Though he did well there and followed all the rules, he became a victim for a second time, when his master\u2019s wife accused him of a crime he didn\u2019t commit. Over a period of 13 years, Joseph worked as a slave and spent years locked up in prison. After a series of unlikely events, some terrible and some remarkable, Joseph rose to power and became the king\u2019s right hand man, his adviser.\nWith the king\u2019s blessing and support, Joseph led his country in preparing for a famine, putting food away on reserve during seven years of plenty. When a famine struck the land, Egypt was in a good position, able to lean on the reserved food that Joseph had put away. The surrounding lands, including Joseph\u2019s homeland, had to lean on Egypt for food or else they would starve.\nJoseph shows his brother\u2019s enormous generosity. He has them go home, pack up and move their entire family, including their elderly father Jacob to Egypt to be near Joseph. Not long after making the trip to Egypt and being reunited with his father, their father, an elderly man at this point, Jacob dies.\nAnd the final chapter of the story opens. Jacob is dead. Their father is gone. Now what?",
                "Early in the morning, while it was still dark, God defeated the powers and principalities in the ultimate act of resistance\u2014resurrection. The grave could not contain the Lord. Even death wasn\u2019t enough.\nIn the resurrection, God defeats the powers of death and shows that it\u2019s God who has the final Word. Nothing, not even death, can keep us from being fully known by God. The powers try to have the final say on our names, our identities, the markers by which we measure ourselves, the systems that hold people captive or keep people in oppression. But Jesus calls us out of the darkness by name.\nOn this Easter Sunday, we hear our Risen Lord calling our names from the darkness\u2014Jesus, the resurrected one, the name above all names, the great I am, the Prince of Peace, the alpha and omega, the light of the world. The risen Lord has spoken.\nThis is the name unto which you were baptized. As you come forward and mark the sign of the cross on your forehead today, hear Jesus speaking your name from the darkness and drawing you into the light.\nFrom our worship service on the fifth Sunday of Lent, April 2, 2017.\n\u201cIs the Lord really with us or not?\u201d \u201cIs the Lord really with us or not?\u201d Why did you bring us all the way from Egypt to let us die of thirst in this desert? At least in Egypt, we had water. At least in Egypt, we weren\u2019t so thirsty. At least in Egypt, we knew what tomorrow would hold. At least in Egypt, we weren\u2019t so thirsty.\nBut no, that\u2019s not the story they give us. They are hard on their ancestors. They tell how it is. The elders who sat and wrote down these stories understood something about our bodies, who we are and how we work. After all the generations these stories passed through, they tell the truth about how quickly we forget, about how quickly we complain, about how quickly we grow thirsty, about how much we need water.",
                "We do not have to live in fear. We do not have to be motivated or paralyzed by it. Look at the God that we serve! Joseph explains how God has been with him. He says to his brothers, \u201cEven though you intended to do harm to me, God intended it for good, in order to preserve a numerous people, as he is doing today.\u201d Does this mean that God wanted or desired Joseph\u2019s brothers to kidnap him, throw him into slavery and ruin his life to avenge their jealousy? No. God doesn\u2019t desire that jealousy and revenge rule our lives. God doesn\u2019t will for us to do evil or to harm other people. Rather, God is able to overcome evil and transform it. God can overcome evil! When Jesus was captured, tried as a criminal and sentenced to death, God overcame death, raising Jesus from the death.\nThis post was adapted from my sermon preached at Butner Federal Prison on September 14, 2014.\nWe were gathered at the plaza, right between the giant bull statue and the unattractive fences of a construction site. Luminary bags weighted with rice and lit candles marked the sacred space surrounding 30 of us, one to represent each person who died as a result of domestic violence the previous year in our state. The vigil began as planned, simple, but meaningful, to remember victims of this tragedy and raise awareness about the suffering that takes place behind closed doors. About halfway through the simple service, a woman stumbled into the vigil, interrupting the solemn mood without realizing that a group was gathered and someone was speaking. She stood silent for a few moments, listening to the speaker. When she realized that the speaker was talking about domestic violence, she began to interrupt, asking questions to the speaker, sharing details from her own experience with abuse. \u201cWhat would you do\u2026what would you do if\u2026?\u201d she cried. Then, as unexpectedly as she joined us and as abruptly as her interruption, she began to weep, uncontrollably crying for the rest of the vigil. A couple of women gathered around her and held her as she wept. Before long, it was my turn to pray. I barely got the words out\u2026I could hardly project my shaking voice over her loud sobs.",
                "This is a story about 4 fishermen, Simon, Andrew, James and John. It\u2019s a normal morning at the docks. Each one of them is going about business as usual. They arrived at dawn, bundled up in the cool morning air and started work without much conversation. Simon and Andrew are working on one fishing boat and see the Teacher approaching. \u201cHey. There he is,\u201d says Andrew. Jesus from Nazareth. You can\u2019t go anywhere without hearing about him lately. What\u2019s he doing down here?\u201d They paddle back to shore, not wanting to miss any trouble this Jesus fellow might stir up. Simon and Andrew get the beach and Jesus comes over to talk to them. It\u2019s like he had come there that morning just to find these two guys. Jesus didn\u2019t say much, \u201cCome and follow me.\u201d Jesus invited these 2 fishermen to be his disciples, to follow after him, to walk behind him, tracing his every step.\nFurther down the beach, the same scene repeats. This time, Jesus walks directly up to James and John who are focused on repairing their fishing net. Jesus says the same thing to them and now all four fishermen walk behind their rabbi with no idea of what\u2019s ahead of them.\nIt\u2019s a big deal! The four normal guys, working a normal job, on a normal morning, decide to follow Jesus. Maybe you\u2019ve wondered like I have, how is it that Simon, Andrew, James and John do it? How do they drop everything to follow Jesus? What were they thinking? How did they feel?\nIt\u2019s interesting. The story doesn\u2019t tell us. There\u2019s nothing about how they felt. It doesn\u2019t say they were excited, or moved, or scared, or joyful or resistant. This story about four fisherman gives us only verbs. Jesus passed alongside the Galilee Sea. He saw two brothers. He said, Come, follow. Then, Simon and Andrew left and followed. Jesus saw James and John. Jesus called them. They followed him.\nThis is a story about four fisherman who decided to follow Jesus.",
                "The Israelites who wrote down this story and allowed the ancestors to look like desperate complainers who doubted God and tested God, they were onto something. They knew that we are thirsty people. Jesus knew also. All who are thirsty, come! All who believe in me, drink this living water! We are desperate to feel God\u2019s presence, to be bathed in the water of the Spirit, to know that this is not all there is, to feel a sense of belonging to the One who is greater than I. We can only make it so long in the desert, so long wandering from one trial to the next, without a drink.\nAnd yet, Jesus also says, \u201cBlessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled. Notice with me: not blessed are those who are righteous, but those who thirst for righteousness. Not blessed are those who are righteous, but those who thirst for righteousness. Blessed are those who thirst for relationship with God, to know God, to see God.\nI wonder, \u201cDoes Jesus want us to keep wanting?\u201d Does Jesus want us to keep thirsting? Many faithful followers of Jesus throughout history have never claimed their thirst was quenched, never fully satisfied. You know that moment when you quench your thirst, when you sigh with relief when your throat is at ease once again, that\u2019s the opposite of how many of God\u2019s children have described the life of faith. They describe wanting more, being satisfied at times, while knowing they will be thirsty again.\nWhat will be waiting for you at the rock? Will the water gush out, bursting forth, covering you from head to toe with God\u2019s presence, drenching you in hope, cleansing you from the dust that\u2019s caked to your feet and renewing you for a new day, a new hour, a new moment basking in the presence of God?",
                "This blog post was adapted from Pastor Megan\u2019s sermon at Butner Federal Prison on January 25, 2015.\nThe life of faith consists of seasons. One scholar suggests that we can categorize these seasons of life as seasons of being securely oriented, painfully disoriented, and surprisingly reoriented. These generalizations could apply to our self-acceptance, our relations to significant others, and our participation in public or private life. We might think about these seasons as passages of life, stages of growth, or even identity crises. Acknowledging where we find ourselves in a particular season can allow us to be honest about where we are at in our lives and where we are in relation to God.\nThe Psalms, a collection of prayers, songs, and poems addressed to God, correspond to these seasons of orientation, disorientation, and reorientation. As we read through the book, we find Psalms where the writer is full of thanksgiving to God, securely oriented in life. We also find Psalms that demonstrate disorientation, perhaps categorized by loss, transition, grief, suffering, or even anger. Finally, some Psalms are written from a perspective of reorientation, wherein the Psalmist transitions from a period of being disoriented to being reoriented in relation to God and others.\nThe Psalms can become our partner in prayer. Giving us words when we have none, we pray the Psalms joining with all those who have prayed them before us and all who will pray them after we are gone. As we pray the Psalms, we find permission to be utterly honest with God about our feelings and situation, free to speak openly and deeply to God about what we are experiencing. Praying the Psalms also helps us to envision God\u2019s future when we can\u2019t see it ourselves. Lastly, the Psalms guard us against religion or merely thinking about God. Using their words in prayer brings us into direct conversation with the living God, in language we may never have imagined would come from our lips.\n-Pray the assigned Psalm from the daily lectionary, with set Scriptures to read each day.

                "This is also a story about fishing. I\u2019ve been fishing been fishing three or four times. Once I realized that fishing was primarily a crack of dawn activity, I knew it wasn\u2019t really for me. Jesus uses a kind of puzzling image about fishing. He says, \u201cCome, follow me, and I\u2019ll show you how to fish for people.\u201d I don\u2019t know about you, but this I find this to be very strange. I realized this week why his image is so confusing to me. What do you imagine when someone talks about fishing? What I imagine when I hear the word \u201cfish\u201d or \u201cfishing\u201d is a fishing pole, the rod, reel, bait, tackle box, worms, that kind of fishing. So I\u2019ve always interpreted what Jesus said this way.\nI will make you fishers of men, fishers of men, fishers of men. I will make you fishers of men, if you follow me.\nThe road Jesus invites these four fishermen to follow him on will mean casting a net of love and welcome to people that they do not anticipate. Jesus will cast his net into the sea of a broken world, filled with sinners, people who have messed up, people who are outsiders, who don\u2019t belong. Jesus will stay in the homes of poor, be guilty of associating prostitutes and touching the hands of people with communicable diseases. Jesus will throw his net into the sea and invite everyone in. Jesus will eventually be arrested and executed because those in power decided his fishing net included a few too many of the wrong people. This is a story about fishing.\nThis isn\u2019t only a story about four fisherman, or only a story about fishing. It\u2019s also, and perhaps, most importantly, a story about God.",
                "Throughout this Lenten season, we\u2019ve examined the ways that the powers and principalities hold us captive\u2014how they push us towards securing our own survival, dominating others, using God for our own agenda. We\u2019ve seen how in Jesus\u2019 ministry, he\u2019s constantly in resistance mode\u2014exposing the powers for what they really are and envisioning an alternative way of living in the world. He describes this way as \u201cthe kingdom of God,\u201d the living water we drink so we never thirst again, the light of the world. Jesus invites those who follow him into similar acts of resistance\u2014to free us from the power money has on us by giving it away, to choose to see ourselves as Jesus sees us, resisting the shame that says I\u2019m not enough, to practice Sabbath that contradicts productivity, to untie the grave clothes of someone who\u2019s hands and feet are still tied in the trappings of death.\nBut all Jesus\u2019 acts of resistance had a cost. All of the times he just wouldn\u2019t shut up, all of the crowds he attracted because he actually noticed those who were normally ignored, the powers finally said enough is enough and put an end to his resistance the only way they could guarantee silence and division\u2014by nailing him to a tree.\nJust then, she turned and saw a man the shadow of a man behind her; a man she assumed was the gardener, his face unfamiliar in the darkness. He repeated the question\u2014\u201cWoman, why are you crying?\u201d Thinking that perhaps he knew what happened or worse, that he was a culprit, she begged, \u201cSir if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him and I will get him.\u201d But Jesus interrupted her pleading, interrupted her desperation, and called her by name from the darkness, Mary.\nMary. He calls her name. Her name. The name that captures the particularity of her life. To the gardener, she would just be the crying woman. At other points in her life, she was the possessed woman, the woman who wasn\u2019t enough, the woman on the outside of the group. Never nameless\u2014but still unnamed. Never not Mary, but still, not known.",
                "If this is only a story about four fisherman who decide to follow Jesus, the pressures on you and me! After all, aren\u2019t we too called to follow Jesus? Called to be his disciples? Wasn\u2019t that the invitation you first heard when you first heard about Jesus? God has called us and we must decide. Jesus wants us all to follow him, to be like him, to walk in his footsteps, to do what he does. Of course this story is about that! And they do it, don\u2019t they? Simon, Andrew, James, John, they do it! They decide and they do follow Jesus, imperfectly at that. Still, it\u2019s a lot of pressure, a lot of responsibility. If life becomes all about what we do for Jesus, something is missing.\nIf this is only a story about fishing, have some of us failed? Is it too late for us? Some of us might not be the best at fishing, not all the great about casting Jesus\u2019 loving net to our brothers and sisters. His net is sometimes, or maybe more than sometimes, a bit more expansive than we might be comfortable with. He calls us to be like him and fish for people, and yet, sometimes we can barely get the net into the water. Perhaps for others, we aren\u2019t even convinced that Jesus would include us in the net at all, no matter how deep into the water he goes. He can really mean me? Would his net really reach me? There\u2019s still more to the story.\nThis is a story about God, who God is, how God acts, what God does. Before Andrew, Simon, James and John follow Jesus, Jesus finds them. Before they follow Jesus, Jesus comes to them! They don\u2019t have to go searching, they have been found. Jesus saw. Jesus spoke. Jesus called. Jesus said, \u201cCome.\u201c We don\u2019t follow Jesus in order to find him, to prove our worthiness with what we do, or even by showing Jesus how big our nets are. We follow Jesus because he first came to us. He came down to the beach to meet these four fishermen. He came specifically for Simon and for Andrew, for James and for John, for you and me.",

Pastor Megan preached this sermon at Butner Federal Prison complex on August 30, 2015.\nOn Father\u2019s Day 2015, we gathered for worship at the labyrinth in front of UNC hospital, having devoted the month of June to exploring the question, \u201cWhat happens after we die?\u201d Many have watched their father\u2019s die in this place or other similar spaces. We shared in a time of both remembrance and prayer/meditation, participating in the ancient spiritual practice of walking the labyrinth. A labyrinth is a kind of maze, laid out in a circle.\nTony graciously shared the following reflections from his experience at the labyrinth on the hot June day.\nIt\u2019s smaller than I expected, stark and hard\u2010surfaced, with no landscaping for ornamentation or shade. I don\u2019t know what to expect from it\u2026 or from myself. But that\u2019s part of the appeal. I stand at the entrance, hesitating, trying to clear my mind. This doesn\u2019t work very well, so I just start walking.",
                "A Homily from Easter Sunday, 2017.\nEarly on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the tomb. But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb. As she wept, she bent over to look[a] into the tomb; and she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had been lying, one at the head and the other at the feet. They said to her, \u201cWoman, why are you weeping?\u201d She said to them, \u201cThey have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.\u201d When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to her, \u201cWoman, why are you weeping? Whom are you looking for?\u201d Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, \u201cSir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.\u201d Jesus said to her, \u201cMary!\u201d She turned and said to him in Hebrew,[b] \u201cRabbouni!\u201d (which means Teacher). Jesus said to her, \u201cDo not hold on to me, because I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and say to them, \u2018I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.\u2019\u201d Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, \u201cI have seen the Lord\u201d; and she told them that he had said these things to her.\nEarly in the morning, while it was still dark, Mary wept in the throws of grief. Early in the morning, while it was still dark, Mary dragged herself out of bed after a sleepless night and walked to the tomb in a kind of trance. Early in the morning, while it was still dark, Mary cried\u2014scared, confused, alone. Early in the morning, while it was still dark, Mary thought that the powers of death had the last Word. Early in the morning, while it was still dark, Mary heard a voice in the darkness calling her name\u2014Mary.",

Joseph's dreams of ruling over his brothers, which he shared openly, further fueled their resentment. The combination of his dreams, his father's special robe, and favoritism led his brothers to plot against him, setting the stage for the dramatic events that follow in his story.",
                "Jesus declares that those who mourn are blessed, as they will be comforted. This mourning is a response to injustice and oppression, not just personal sorrow. In the Jewish tradition, mourning is a communal practice, with prophets and Psalms expressing collective lament. Jesus' beatitude challenges societal norms by blessing those who suffer due to injustice, exposing the powers that cause such suffering. In God's kingdom, mourners are not marginalized but are comforted and heard by God.",
                "Fear prevents the brothers from confessing and receiving forgiveness, as they struggle with guilt and self-worth. Joseph has already offered forgiveness, but they haven't fully accepted it. Their fear of forgiveness and self-forgiveness stems from the deep-rooted guilt they carry. Joseph's emotional response of weeping, which leads to the brothers also weeping, highlights that the process of overcoming fear and achieving forgiveness may involve emotional vulnerability and shared sorrow.",

Joseph, moved to tears, reassures them that God turned their intended harm into good, and promises to care for them and their families. The brothers, in turn, express submission and fear, distancing themselves from their past actions. Joseph's response emphasizes his role as a provider and protector, not a punisher, offering them comfort and kindness.",
                "Mourning is often seen as a private, inactive practice, but it actually prompts action and engagement. Public displays of mourning can expose the true nature of power structures and force people to confront suffering and injustice. An example of this is a woman's loud wailing at a vigil, which made the author uncomfortable but also compelled them to seek justice for others who have suffered. Mourning is not a waste of time; it disrupts and challenges, leading to a deeper engagement with the issues at hand.",

The Israelites' panic over lack of water reflects their awareness of daily dependence on it for survival. The Samaritan woman, marginalized by her society, sought water alone to avoid stigma, but met Jesus, who also needed water. This story highlights the deeper spiritual thirst that only God can satisfy, as Moses turned to God to provide for the Israelites.",

The text contrasts being righteous with thirsting for righteousness, suggesting that the blessed are those who yearn for a deeper relationship with God.

The author initially finds Jesus' metaphor of \"fishing for people\" puzzling, associating fishing with traditional tools like poles and bait. However, the story reveals that Jesus' version of fishing involves casting a net of love and inclusion, reaching out to marginalized and broken individuals. Jesus' inclusive approach leads him to associate with the poor, prostitutes, and those with diseases, ultimately resulting in his arrest and execution by those in power.

Other researchs more similar to our study targeted to help physicians get the point of medical documents quickly by generating a few key sentences - .\nStudies generating contextualized summaries can be categorized by the type of model inputs and architectures. Some studies produced a whole discharge summary using structured data for input - The sensitivity of the gram stain for bacterial meningitis is about 60%, and the sensitivity of the culture is not high either.\nAlso, the glucose in the cerebrospinal fluid would have been slightly lower. Although no definitive diagnosis could be made, bacterial meningitis was the most suspicious disease. The causative organism was assumed to be MRSA, and vancomycin and meropenem (meningitis dose) were used to cover a wide range of enteric bacteria.\na whole discharge summary from free-form inpatient records - . The free-form data is more challenging since it is noisier than structured data. In inputting of the free-form data, extractive summarization methods, which extract sentences from the source, are commonly used , - . On the other hands, an encoder-decoder model was used for abstractive summarization , , with a limited number of studies.\nThe various issues in the abstractive generation of discharge summary would be studied in the future. Studies using medical meta-information have long been conducted on a lot of tasks - . In abstractive summarization on discharge summary,  developed a model incorporating similarity of progress notes and information of the record author.\nThey presented an idea of integrating meta-information into the abstractive summarization model on medical documents, but did not reveal how meta-information would affect the quality of the summaries. Our method is based on the encoder-decoder transformer model. The transformer model is known for its high performance and has been widely used in recent studies, thus it is suitable for our purpose.",

In our model, number of layers, window size, dilation, input sequence length, output sequence length, batch size, learning rate and number of warmup steps are 8, 256, 1, 1024, 256, 4, 3e-5 and 1K, respectively.\nOther hyperparameters are the same as in the original Longformer, except for the maximum number of epochs is not fixed and the best epoch. It is selected for each training using the validation data based on ROUGE-1. Also, the original Longformer imports pretrained-BART parameters to initial values, but we do not use pre-trained Japanese BART in this study.\nWe used three GeForce RTX 2080 TI for our experiments. Our vocabulary for preparing input to Longformer is taken from UTH-BERT , which is pre-trained on the Japanese clinical records. Since the vocabulary of UTH-BERT is trained by WordPiece , we also tokenize our data with WordPiece. However, the vocabulary does not include white space and line breaks, which cannot be handled, so we add those two tokens to the vocabulary, resulting in a total size of 25,002.\nThe vocabulary has all tokens in full characters, so we normalized full-wdith characters by converting all alphanumeric and symbolic characters to half-width for byte fallback. , we found that all the models with encoded medical meta-information perform better in ROUGE-1, ROUGE-L and BLEURT than the vanilla Longformer.\nHowever, in BERTScore, only hospital and disease models outperform the vanilla. Specifically, disease information is most effective, improving ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, BERTScore and BLEURT by 4.45, 0.73, 3.12, 3.77 and 0.21 points over the vanilla model, respectively.

In all hospitals, there is a large difference between the median and the maximum of cases/physician. This indicates that a few physicians handle a large number of cases and many physicians handle fewer cases.\nIt is impossible to avoid physician IDs first seen at test time without some process that averages the number of cases a physician holds.",
                "As shown in Figure , the standard input to a transformer's encoder is created by a token sequence T = [t 0 , t 1 , ..., t i ] and position sequence P = [p 0 , p 1 , ..., p i ], where i is the maximum input length. The token and position sequences are converted into token embeddings E T and positional embeddings E P by looking up the vocabulary tables.\nThe sum of E T and E P is input into the model. In this paper, we attempt to encode meta-information to feature embeddings. We follow the segment embeddings of BERT and the language embeddings of XLM , which provide additional information to the model. It is not a new idea but is suitable for our validation.\nOur method is formulated as follows: Let M be feature type, M \u2208 {Vanilla, Hospital, Physician, Disease, Length of stay}, since we set five types of features. Feature embeddings E M is created by looking up the feature table where m j is featue value (e.g., pysician ID, disease code, etc.) and |M | is the maximum number of differences in a feature.\nIn our study, |M | is set to four different values depending on features. Specifically, they are as follows. a) Hospital: As shown in Table , the data includes five hospital records. They were obtained mechanically from the EHR system. b) Physician: Physicians are also managed by IDs in the EHR systems. We hashed the physician IDs into 485 groups containing 10 people each.\nSpecifically, as a naive strategy, we shuffled and listed the cases within each hospital, and hashed them into groups in the order of appearance of the physician IDs. So each group has the information about the relevance of the hospitals. The reason for employing a grouping strategy is described in Appendix A.\nc) Disease: Two types of disease information exist in our EHRs: disease names and disease codes called ICD-10 . We did not use any disease names in the inputs for our experiment. Instead, we encoded diseases with the first three letters of the ICD-10 code, because they represent well the higher level concept.",

                "The initial three letters of the ICD-10 codes are arranged in the order of an alphabetic letter, a digit, and a digit, so there are a total of 2,600 ways to encode a disease. In our data, some ICD-10 codes were missing, although all disease names were systematically obtained from the EHR system. For such cases, we converted the disease names into ICD-10 codes using MeCab with the J-MeDic (MANBYO 201905) dictionary.\nAlso, diseases can be divided into primary and secondary diseases, but we only deal with the primary diseases. d) Length of stay: The length of stay can be obtained mechanically from the EHR system and the maximum value was set to 1,000 days. We set |M | for vanilla, hospital, physician, disease, and length of stay to 1, 5, 485, 2,600, and 1,000, respectively .\nThe vanilla embedding is prepared for the baseline in our experiment and to equalize the total number of parameters with the other models. The input to our model is the sum of E T , E P and E M . We also prepare an extra model with all features for our experiments. This takes all four feature embeddings (hospital, physician, disease, and length of stay) added to the encoder.",
                "Clinical notes are written daily by physicians from their consults and are used for their own decision-making or coordination of treatment. They contain a large amount of important data for machine learning, such as conditions, laboratory tests, diagnoses, procedures, and treatments. While invaluable to physicians and researchers, the paperwork is burdensome for physicians , .\nDischarge summaries, a subset of these, also play a crucial role in patient care, and are used to share information between hospitals and physicians (see an example in Figure ). It is created by the physician as a summary of notes during hospitalization at the time of the patient's discharge, which is known to be very time-consuming.\nResearchers have begun to apply automatic summarization techniques to address this problem - . Previous studies used extractive or abstractive summarization methods, but most of them focused on only progress notes for inputs. Properly summarizing an admission of a patient is a quite complex task, and requires various meta-information such as the patient's age, gender, vital signs, laboratory values and background to specific diseases.\nTherefore, discharge summary generation needs more medical meta-information, than similar but narrower tasks such as radiology report generation. However, what kind of meta-information is important for summarization has not been investigated, even though it is critical not only for future research on medical summarization but also for the policy of data collection infrastructure.\nIn this paper, we first reveal the effects of meta-information on neural abstractive summarization on admissions. Our model is based on an encoder-decoder transformer with an additional feature embedding layer in the encoder (Figure ). Hospital, physician, disease, and length of stay are used as meta-information, and each feature is embedded in the vector space.\nFor experiments, we collect progress notes, discharge summaries and coded information from the electronic health record system, which are managed by a largest multi-hospital organization in Japan. Our main contributions are as follows: \u2022 We found that a transformer encoding meta-information generates higher quality summaries than the vanilla one, and clarified the benefit of using meta-information for medical summarization tasks.",
                "This suggests that different hospitals and physicians have different description habits (e.g., bullet points such as \"\u2022\", \"*\" and \"-\", punctuation such as \"\u3002\" and \".\", etc.), which can be grouped by meta-information. In this paper, we conducted a discharge summary generation experiment by adding four types of information to Longformer and verified the impact of the meta-information.\nThe results showed that all four types of information exceeded the performance of the vanilla Longformer model, with the highest performance achieved by encoding disease information. We found that meta-information is useful for abstractive summarization on discharge summaries. Our limitations are that we used Japanese EHR, the limited number of tested features and not performing human evaluations.\nAs for the efficacy of the meta-information, we believe that our results are applicable to non-Japanese, but it is left as Fig. . The precisions of words in the generated summaries. The vertical axis shows the probability that the words exist in the gold summary. a future work. Other meta-information may be worth verifying such as the patient's gender, age, race, religion and used EHR system, etc.\nIt is hard to collect a large amount of medical information and process it into meta-information, so we may need to develop a robust and flexible research infrastructure to conduct a more large scale cross-sectional study in the future. In the discharge summary generation task, which demands a high level of expertise, the human evaluation requires a lot of physicians' efforts and it is a very high cost which is unrealistic.\nThis is a general issue in tasks dealing with medical documents, and this study also could not perform human evaluations. On this research, informed consent and patient privacy are ensured in the following manner. Notices about their policy and the EHR data usage are posted at the hospitals. The patients who disagree with the policies can request opt-out and are excluded from the archive.\nIn case of minors and their parents, followed the same manner. In the case of minors and their parents are same. To conduct a research on the archive, researchers must submit their research proposals to the institutional review board. After the proposal is approved, the data is anonymized to build a dataset for analysis.",
                "In contrast, in ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L, the model with physician embedding is inferior to the vanilla model. This seems to be a negative effect of grouping physicians without any consideration of their relevance. It would be better to cluster them by department, physician attributes, similarity of progress notes, etc. Regarding low ROUGE-2 scores in all models, a previous study using the English data set also reported a low ROUGE-2 score of about 5%, which may indicate an inherent difficulty in discharge summary generation.\nIn BERTScore, the models with the physician and the length of stay did not reach the performance of the vanilla model, suggesting that the system's outputs are semantically inferior. The model with all features performed the lowest of all models in BERTScore. The reason for the low score of the model with all features seems to be that its number of parameters in feature embedding was four times larger than that of the model with the individual feature, and the amount of training data was insufficient.\nIn BLEURT, all models with meta-information outperform vanilla, which suggests that they are more natural to humans. To analyze the influence of encoded meta-information on the outputs, we evaluate the precisions of the generated text. Specifically, we measure the probability that the generated words are included in the gold summary to investigate if the proper words are generated.\nSome previous studies on faithfulness, which also analyze the output of summarization, have employed words or entities - . In this study, we focused on words, not entities, because we wanted to visualize expressions that are not only nouns. The words were segmented by MeCab with the J-MeDic. For each segmented word, the numeral and symbol labels were assigned as parts of speech by MeCab, the morphological analyzer, while the disease and symptom were assigned by the J-Medic dictionary.\nThe results, shown in Figure , indicate that the encoded disease information leads to generate more proper disease and symptom words. This indicates that the meta-information successfully learns disease-related expressions. The encoded hospital or physician information also improved the precision of symbols generation.",
                "During the patient's hospitalization, the physician must record daily observations of the patient and summarize them into a brief document called \"discharge summary\" when the patient is discharged. Automated generation of discharge summary can greatly relieve the physicians' burden, and has been addressed recently in the research community.\nMost previous studies of discharge summary generation using the sequenceto-sequence architecture focus on only inpatient notes for input. However, electric health records (EHR) also have rich structured metadata (e.g., hospital, physician, disease, length of stay, etc.) that might be useful. This paper investigates the effectiveness of medical meta-information for summarization tasks.\nWe obtain four types of meta-information from the EHR systems and encode each meta-information into a sequence-to-sequence model. Using Japanese EHRs, meta-information encoded models increased ROUGE-1 by up to 4.45 points and BERTScore by 3.77 points over the vanilla Longformer. Also, we found that the encoded meta-information improves the precisions of its related terms in the outputs.\nOur results showed the benefit of the use of medical meta-information.\n\nINTRODUCTION",

Due to privacy restrictions, the data is not publicly available. Addressing this imbalance requires a method to distribute cases more evenly among physicians.",
                "The paper introduces a method to encode meta-information into feature embeddings for transformer models. It builds on existing approaches like BERT's segment embeddings and XLM's language embeddings. The authors define five types of features (Vanilla, Hospital, Physician, Disease, Length of stay) and create feature embeddings by looking up corresponding tables. For instance, hospital and physician IDs are hashed into groups, and disease information is encoded using the first three letters of ICD-10 codes. This approach aims to provide additional context to the model, enhancing its understanding of the input data.",
                "The study evaluated a proposed method using a subset of data from Japan's National Hospital Organization (NHO), comprising 24,630 cases from five hospitals. The data, which includes discharge summaries and progress notes, was split into 22,630 training, 1,000 validation, and 1,000 test cases.

BERTScore revealed that models with physician and length of stay features were semantically inferior to the vanilla model, and the model with all features performed the worst due to excessive parameters and insufficient training data.

                "\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:introduction}\n\nProbabilistic models have proven to be very useful in a lot of applications in signal processing where signal estimation is needed \\cite{rabiner1989tutorial,arulampalam2002tutorial,ji2008bayesian}. Some of their advantages are that 1) they force the designer to specify all the assumptions of the model, 2) they provide a clear separation between the model and the algorithm used to solve it, and 3) they usually provide some measure of uncertainty about the estimation.\n\nOn the other hand, adaptive filtering is a standard approach in estimation problems when the input is received as a stream of data that is potentially non-stationary. This approach is widely understood and applied to several problems such as echo cancellation \\cite{gilloire1992adaptive}, noise cancellation \\cite{nelson1991active}, and channel equalization \\cite{falconer2002frequency}.\n\nAlthough these two approaches share some underlying relations, there are very few connections in the literature. The first important attempt in the signal processing community to relate these two fields was the connection between a linear Gaussian state-space model (i.e. Kalman filter) and the RLS filter, by Sayed and Kailath \\cite{sayed1994state} and then by Haykin \\emph{et al.} \\cite{haykin1997adaptive}. The RLS adaptive filtering algorithm emerges naturally when one defines a particular state-space model (SSM) and then performs exact inference in that model. This approach was later exploited in \\cite{van2012kernel} to design a kernel RLS algorithm based on Gaussian processes.\n\nA first attempt to approximate the LMS filter from a probabilistic perspective was presented in \\cite{park2014probabilistic}, focusing on a kernel-based implementation. The algorithm of \\cite{park2014probabilistic} makes use of a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimate as an approximation for the predictive step. However, this approximation does not preserve the estimate of the uncertainty in each step, therefore degrading the performance of the algorithm.",

We show how the computation of this approximated posterior leads to a linear-complexity algorithm, comparable to the standard LMS. Similar approaches have already been developed for a variety of problems such as channel equalization using recurrent RBF neural networks \\cite{cid1994recurrent}, or Bayesian forecasting \\cite{harrison1999bayesian}. Here, we show the usefulness of this probabilistic approach for adaptive filtering.\n\nThe probabilistic perspective we adopt throughout this work presents two main advantages. Firstly, a novel LMS algorithm with adaptable step size emerges naturally with this approach, making it suitable for both stationary and non-stationary environments. The proposed algorithm has less free parameters than previous LMS algorithms with variable step size \\cite{kwong1992variable,aboulnasr1997robust,shin2004variable}, and its parameters are easier to be tuned w.r.t. these algorithms and standard LMS. Secondly, the use of a probabilistic model provides us with an estimate of the error variance, which is useful in many applications.\n\nExperiments with simulated and real data show the advantages of the presented approach with respect to previous works.

The key themes are as follows:\n\n1. **Adaptive Rule and Gaussian Approximation**: The text assumes an approximate Gaussian posterior distribution at each time step, leading to a predictive distribution that is also Gaussian. This approximation results in an LMS-like adaptive rule, where the posterior mean and variance are iteratively updated.\n\n2. **Posterior Distribution and Bayes' Theorem**: The posterior distribution at each time step is approximated using Bayes' Theorem and Gaussian manipulations, resulting in an isotropic Gaussian distribution. The mean and variance of this distribution are updated iteratively, with a scalar gain \\(\\eta_k\\) replacing the gain matrix used in RLS methods.\n\n3. **Posterior Variance and LMS Algorithm**: The posterior variance, a measure of uncertainty, is derived and simplified. The resulting expression for \\(\\hat{\\sigma}_k^2\\) involves a scalar gain \\(\\eta_k\\), which functions as a variable step size in the LMS algorithm. The weight update in the LMS algorithm is defined with this step size, allowing for adaptable step-size LMS.\n\n4. **Complexity and Parameterization**: The adaptive rule has linear complexity, avoiding the computation of full matrices. The algorithm has fewer parameters (two in non-stationary scenarios and one in stationary scenarios) compared to other variable step-size algorithms, with clear physical meanings that can often be estimated.\n\n5. **Performance Evaluation**: The study evaluates the performance of the proposed algorithm in stationary and tracking experiments. It compares the proposed probabilistic LMS algorithm against standard RLS and other LMS-based algorithms (LMS, NLMS, VSS-LMS). The results show that the probabilistic LMS algorithm closely matches RLS performance but with significantly lower computational cost. It outperforms other variable step-size LMS methods in the literature, especially in stationary conditions where the uncertainty and adaptive step size diminish over time.\n\n6. **Robustness and Uncertainty**: The study highlights the robustness of the proposed approach, as even a suboptimal version of the probabilistic LMS algorithm (with a noise variance 100 times smaller than the optimal value) performs well. The uncertainty in the estimation is visualized with a shaded area representing two standard deviations from the prediction.\n\nIn summary, the text presents a novel adaptive LMS-like algorithm derived from Gaussian approximations, demonstrating its efficiency, robustness, and superior performance compared to existing methods, particularly in stationary environments."

So I flipped the turtledeck over and from 1/4 inch last-a-foam, I cut two inch wide strips that would run the entire length, forward and aft inside the turtledeck. In effect these would act as composite stringers, I made enough of these two inch wide strips to make up three stringers. One down the center (sort of a backbone) and one on each side of the \"backbone\" half the distance to the edge of the turtledeck. I sanded the edge of the foam so that when covered with a layer of bid @ 45degrees there would be a nice transition from the turtledeck skin up onto the foam and then back onto the turtledeck I scuff sanded and glued the foam stringers in with micro. I covered the foam stringers with one layer of 8oz bid @ 45degrees.\nYou can also send me email at: mikemims@pacbell.net if you have any questions or want to share your ideas.\nKROnline is an online KR Newsletter devoted to sharing KR information with other builders and pilots in a timely manner.

                "I chose to sand the load of micro off the left wing to see what it was covering. When I got down to the glass, I found that there was no glass for the aft inch and a half of the underside of the wing in front of the aileron hinge. With the Diehl wing skins, you build the wings, then cut the ailerons out of trailing edge of the wing. He had mismeasured and cut too much material off the bottom side of the trailing edge in front of the aileron. It was filled by floxing a piece of spruce into the gap to fill the space between the back edge of the fiberglass and the aileron mount. I chose to wrap the trailing edge of that wing, and the other wing to match with a couple of lay-ups of glass.\nWhen I sanded the primer off the aforementioned damaged trim tab, I found that the hinge was floxed to the leading edge of the foam insides of the tab, but not the glass. I also chose to wrap the front of the trim tab with a lay-up of glass.\nI decided to pull the paper off the canopy and take a look at it before I'm ready to bolt it on and fly. The original builder had blown his own canopy and after some of the previous problems, I was beginning to have some concerns about not having looked it over closely enough. The canopy turned out to have been blow a little too large. It ended up with a little larger bubble for headroom, which I didn't object to. However, it had more headroom on the right side than the left. Yes, it was just a little bit lopsided. The main problem was that the canopy is stretched thin enough that it can be easily pushed in with one hand when the weather is warm.. My fear was that this is just thin enough that it may decide to lay on my head or in my lap when flying on a warm day. It will have to be replaced.",
                "Over the past twenty years I've owned a number of planes, but still always wanted to build my own. I needed one that would fit me, my budget requirements, and have the speed and performance that I wanted. When \"KITPLANES\" published the article featuring Roy Marsh's new KR-2S, it was the first I had heard of any major modifications or improvements to the same old KR design. I believe that article and Roy Marsh's workmanship have probably been the greatest boon to Rand Robinson (RR) in the last twenty years. It certainly caught my eye! Here was the same design I had decided I wanted to build twenty years ago, with all of the improvements I wanted. It was sitting on fixed gear with some reasonable ground clearance. It had the capability to be built large enough to accommodate me. It has enough prefab parts available that it didn't have to be 100% scratch built if I decided to hurry the project along. And it had the speed I wanted. I knew that Roy's published speeds were probably not realistic expectations for the average KR, but after knocking around for the last three years in my Champ, anything over 90 mph seems pretty fast to me.\nAfter purchasing the info kit and the sales video from Rand Robinson, the next step after deciding for sure to build this plane was to order the KR-2 plans and the KR-2S addendum. I finally got my plans and was putting together my first order to start the plane, when my partner in the Champ pointed out that there was a partially completed KR-2S for sale in Trade-a-plane. My initial answer was \"No, I don't even want to look at it. I want to build my own from scratch.\" My partner insisted that for the advertised price and the fact that it wasn't too far away, I ought to at least give the guy a call and investigate it. \"No, I don't think I want to buy someone else's problems,\" I persisted. That night I went home and crunched up some numbers on the calculator and finally came to the conclusion that for the sake of my budget for the next several years, I really should give this guy a call.",
                "I decided that I had to remove the rear fittings from the left wing to be replaced with the new set that my neighborhood machinist was cutting out for me. When I put the wing on the work bench to start removing the rear fittings, I thought I had better take a closer look at the bubbles in the leading edge. I found that as I pushed on the leading edge, it delaminated between the glass lay-up on top and the upper and lower wing skin edges that were floxed together underneath. I concluded that that area had to come apart and took a belt sander to the leading edge. What I found was that the leading edge had been floxed together and glassed over, but the mold release had never been scrubbed off the leading edge of the wing. It peeled apart for rebuild quite easily.\nWhen I got back to removing the rear spar attach fittings, I noticed that the woodwork inside the wing looked awfully dull. The reason was that the wing had been closed up without varnishing any of the woodwork. This was rectified with a small hole saw, a number of extensions and a modified undercoating sprayer.\nI also found that the aluminum drain fitting in the bottom of the left wing tank had been glassed into place upside down. The tapered pipe threads were tapered the wrong way to install the draincock into the tank. Retapping the fitting the right direction seemed to be a good fix for that problem.\nWhen I finally got around to attaching the wing to the fuselage, I found that the front spar attach fittings were badly misaligned. Although they could be forced into alignment, I didn't think I needed that kind of preload on the main spar fittings. This problem was fixed by calling on my local neighborhood machinist to build me an aligning fixture and reaming the attach holes to the next larger size and ordering the new sized bolts.\nOn the fuselage I found that although it had new Cleveland wheels and brakes on it, one of the brakes had a severe wobble to it. I must complement the manufacturers for taking care of that problem. One call to the Cleveland factory and they shipped me a new set of wheels and brakes even though the receipt for this set was over four years old and in the original builders name. Their only concern was that this set had never been placed in service yet.",
                "I found that the lower set of rear spar attach fittings on the left rear spar were installed backwards with the longer spaced hole towards the fuselage. Since this is the same place that also had the cracked spar cap, it required a major change. Also in the same area he had drilled through the rear spar with a hole saw to create a place for the aileron cable to pass through and managed to cut out the second from the outside vertical brace in the spar. Then he chose to install the aileron bellcranks in front of the rear spar, and cut another hole through the rear spar for the aileron push rod. He also managed to cut out the outside vertical brace in the spar. Since the holes were already drilled through the spar, the choices were to either cut out that section of spar cap and scarf a new piece in, cut the whole rear spar carrythrough out of the fuselage including ruining the left lower wing skin, or do something else creative to reinforce the spar cap and install a custom built set of attach fittings.\nI also found that after I built and installed the right side wing stub ribs and skin that the aileron bellcrank setup would not work as installed. The cable that crosses between the two bellcranks had a sharp uphill from the sheeve to the bellcrank in the last 12 inches on either side. This combined with the radius that the bellcranks turn caused the cross cable to pull up tight when the ailerons were pushed to either end of their travel, but allowed the cables to go very slack when the ailerons were centered. Also the Aileron pushrods needed to pass directly through the lower set of rear wing attach fittings to attach to the aileron. This whole rear spar and aileron bellcrank setup was going to either have to be redesigned or cut out and built to plans. The bottom line is that the problems I observed when I inspected this part were much more serious than expected when I had to fix it.",
                "At this point it was starting to get late and my ride down needed to get airborne for the flight home. I needed to make a decision about whether I wanted this project or not, but I hadn't inspected the wings and canopy yet. I took a cursory look at the left wing and saw lots on micro built up on it and some bubbles in the leading edge, but nothing that looked seriously wrong to my amateur eye. The right wing was only a set of spars in the shop and the Diehl wing skins in the house, so there wasn't much to look at there. The canopy was wrapped in paper and tape, so there wasn't much to look at there either. I decided that even if there were serious problems in the wing that was built, I would be money ahead to go ahead and buy the project. For the advertised price, I could build a new set of wings and still be way ahead financially. We negotiated a final price, shook hands, took my ride to the airport, and started off in search of a U-haul to haul the project home.\nNow, at this point, some of you are thinking about what I surely must have forgotten to inspect and why didn't I take a local A & P or EAA member along for the ride. First of all, I don't know any mechanics locally that have any experience with glass and our EAA chapter of which I am VP is woefully lacking in fiberglass knowledge. Secondly, as you will see, I missed plenty. Some by ignorance, some by just not looking close enough.\nNow for a list of the problems that I found over the last year and a few of the fixes that I came up with.",
                "I'm sure that many that are reading this could see several of the potential problems before I mentioned them, but some others may not have and I'm sure that there could have been many other problems that didn't but could have existed on this project. This is also not intended to be critical of the gentleman that started this project as many parts of it, especially the wood work are better than I could have done and much of his work is outstanding. I prefer to think that I'll end up with a better plane with his woodwork combined with my glasswork. This article is intended to feature some of the problems that you may run into in buying someone else's project.\nThe final question is, knowing what I have found over the past year, would I have still purchased this project. The answer is yes, but primarily because the price was right in that I am still money and work ahead of where I would be if I had started the project from scratch. There are a few things that I would have done differently, but nothing that I can't live with. Although I won't be able to say that I built it all from scratch, I have built and rebuild enough of the plane that I should have no problem qualifying under the 51% rule.\nYou can send comments directly to the author via e-mail at \"jscott@LANL.GOV\".\nHere is an brief explanation of how I built my turtledecks. The jig was constructed from scrap plywood and a few 1x4s that I ripped into stringers. I made two temporary bulkheads from the plywood, one for each end. Remember the forward bulkhead needs to be shaped in a way that will closely match the aft end of your canopy frame. Make an aft bulkhead by placing a straight edge at the top of your forward bulkhead and the trailing edge of your horizontal stabilizer. This will give you an idea of how tall your aft bulkhead needs to be. As far as location, I placed my aft bulkhead just forward of the lower/front of my vertical fin. I constructed the jig on the fuselage, it is glued together with automotive bondo.",
                "This year's KR Forum featured guest speakers Mike Stearns, Steve Trentman, and Bill Marcey. Mike Stearns spoke on several topics, including the many sources for KR and homebuilding information available on the Internet. He also mentioned KRNet, the list server devoted entirely to KR aircraft, as well as several notable World Wide Web home pages. He also brought a sample of the new Rand Robinson wing skins with him, and discussed their high temperature core prepreg construction. His KR2S will receive the first set, which is currently being installed at Hinson Composites.\nSteve Trentman spoke on his turbine installation. It uses a turbine engine which saw duty as an A7 attack jet starter engine. Total weight is about 85 pounds, while putting out around 90 horsepower. There is a small stockpile of these engines available from government surplus. sources. This engine can only be throttled back to 52% power, which leads to some pretty interesting landings. One inflight failure has been logged so far, with very little damage to the aircraft. More on this exciting development in next month's issue of KROnline.\nLes Palmer's KR2 N202LP won Best KR2, Best Engine Installation, and People's Choice awards at the 1995 KR Gathering at Columbia, TN. After researching the KR series, and reading Neil Bingham's \"A Critical Analysis of the KR2\" (Jan 88 Sport Aviation), Les decided to build his as a single seater, stretched 24\" in the tail, while maintaining a stock width firewall. His fuselage is made from Douglas fir, which weighs in at 4 lbs heavier than if constructed from spruce. It is skinned with 1/8\" birch plywood. Spars are covered with plywoood on both fore and aft sides, ala KR2S. Diehl wing skins provide the lift. Horizontal stabilizer and elevator were stretched 7\" longer on each side, while the vertical stabilizer and rudder were stretched 8\" taller. . The fuselage to cowling junction was made more graceful by adding 1.5 inches to the height of the firewall end of the fuselage sides.\nLes's canopy is a Dragonfly, using a four linkage system to swing forward when opening. The canopy frame fits snugly into a recess in the foward deck, providing an excellent wind and water seal. The fiberglass work is exemplary.\nSeating is luxurious for one.",
                "The cowling is also a work of art, and uses NACA ducts for efficiency. Female molds were made for all the fiberglass parts on Les's plane, so he could proabably be persuaded to make more, if demand dictates. Les also machines a multitude of KR aluminum and steel parts which he now offers for sale.\nThe firewall was reinforced with aluminum brackets and angles bolted between the longerons in anticipation of the 200 lb Subaru EA-81 engine installation. His 100 HP Asian version is outfitted with an American Holley 5200 caburetor and manifold. It uses a PSRU of Les's own design, featuring two spur gears with a 1.69:1 reduction ratio and a toothed belt. Other than tapping the crank for larger bolts to mount the redrive, no other engine modifications were required. Also, this is probably the only air conditioned KR2 on the planet. The prop is a 60/63 Hegy.\nOriginally built as a taildragger, the fixed gear is made from 4130 steel tubing. Custom cast 6.00x6 aluminum wheels and steel rotors are mated with 6\" Cleveland calipers for braking. An early taxi test accident damaged the main gear, and prompted Les to change to tricycle gear. Again, he designed his own fiberglass main gear, and uses a Diehl nose wheel fork with a 4130 strut and 6\" wheel up front.\nEarly tests revealed cooling problems, which prompted a radiator move from the firewall to a lower cowling location.\nThe first flight was almost a disaster, as test pilot Randy Smith lost power right after takeoff. He managed a 180 with a safe downwind landing with only minor nosewheel pant damage. The culprit proved to be a spark plug with too much reach, which was quickly remedied. Subsequent flights have shown water temp to be about 210 degrees, oil temp is 220-230, and airspeed is about 180 mph.\nShopping for the Partially Built KR.\nThis story starts about twenty years ago when I first started looking at the KR-2 as the plane I'd like to build. The only problem at that time was a lack of money, lack of knowledge, and a lack of job stability. I liked the design, except for the low ground clearance of the retractable gear and that a KR was going to be a tight fit for me to fly.",
                "Layout to ensure a fair and true fuselage starts by drawing a reference line (baseline) on the building surface. Refer to figures 2 & 3 and use a wire guide to draw a very straight baseline. About 500 lbs. Of tension should be adequate. One could use a chalk line, but we're talking airplanes here, not house framing.\nThe main layout difference is that the baseline isn't used as a reference for the top longeron. The baseline references the mid point of the firewall for the developed (and true dimensioned) side panel. Although the baseline will still be the reference, the top and bottom longerons will be laid separately.\nLayout differences don't end there. Each of the stations (vertical members) will be laid out with a calculated separation so that when the panels are formed into position, they land on the spacing called for in the plans. Another major difference is that the bottom & side panels are applied after forming the fuselage box section. This is mainly to obtain the ability to \"fair\" the side and bottom surfaces and insure a straight and true shape.\nRefer to figure 1 for the layout of the new developed side panel. The firewall (station a) is layed out perpendicular to the baseline. Longitudinal (station) measurements are given along the length of the baseline from the firewall. Vertical dimensions are given to reference the angle and breadths of the station at the baseline.\nNotice that the top longeron is bowed outward and that the stations are spaced slightly greater than called out in the plans. When the panels are formed into the box frame section ,they will work into the dimensions specified in the plans.\nStrike a centerline, longer than is needed on the building surface using a wire guide. Draw off the firewall line perpendicular to the centerline at one end.\nUsing the distances listed in the balloons, mark them off on the centerline. Distances are measured to the nearest sixteenth of an inch. Take time to mark them off carefully. Don't mark off the distances in a cumulative fashion. Use the firewall as a common reference.\nUsing the angles listed at each station, mark off a station line longer than is needed. The angles are measured to the nearest hundredth of a degree. Take time to mark them off carefully.",
                "They both wanted to build a fast, inexpensive airplane which was also economical to maintain. Several designs were considered, and plans were bought first for the Jeanie's Teenie and then the Taylor Monoplane. The Monoplane was more to their liking, but would require some modification to fit their needs. A cooperative redesign effort ensued, with virtually no dimensions left untouched. Only the basic fuselage structure, airfoil, and powerplant were retained. The tail shape was Stu's, and came directly from the big DC-8s parked on the ramp outside his office window. The landing gear was designed by Ken, after seeing the gear on a Dewey Bird at Santa Paula airport.\nKen was killed in his KR2 a short time later while flying over Cajon Pass in what was apparently a bad weather / low fuel accident. Ken's wife Jeanette became owner of RR overnight, and stepped up to keep the plans and parts coming. Much of the engineering needs are handled by Bill Marcy of Denver, who's been helping out since early '79.\nTo date, almost 6000 KR1, 9200 KR2, and 760 KR2S plan sets have been sold. 1200 KR2s are estimated to be flying, with 5 KR2Ss now in the air. Much of the development work done on KR's is now done by the builders themselves. KR builders tend to be innovative, which leads to some interesting modifications. Some of the mods that work eventually creep into the plans. The KR2S is a case in point. Many builders who'd heard of the pitch sensitivity and tight cabin of the KR2 began to build an enlarged version, with the length determined by the most commonly available longeron material. The result is a KR2 that is stretched 2\" between firewall and main spar, and 14\" behind the main spar. Higher gross weights dictated more wing area, with the new standard becoming the Diehl wing skin. Those who plan to carry passengers commonly stretch the cabin width a few inches, although 1.5 inches is the limit if you still want to use RR's premolded parts.\nMike Stearns addresses the KR Forum crowd.",
                "Three days later, I flew to his place about 400 miles away to take a look at his project. At this point I should probably mention that I consider myself to be fairly knowledgeable about airplane construction, although the vast majority of my experience is with tube and fabric. The rest of this article deals with what I looked for and more importantly what I missed and have had to repair in the last year since I purchased the project.\nWhen we went to the seller's house, I found that the left wing was built using the Dan Diehl wing skins and the right wing skins were leaning against the wall inside the house. Also the canopy was in the house with the canopy covered with paper and tape. I wanted to inspect the fuselage first, so off we went to the shop.\nThere I found a fuselage sitting on it's gear painted in primer gray. The first step was to inspect the quality of workmanship of what could be seen as it sat. The interior of the fuselage looked as if it had been built with a great deal of care. The fit and finish of all of the interior wood was very nice. Even the gussets looked like they had been painstakingly perfectly fitted. The glass work on the turtle back also looked very precise and clean. It was evenly faired into the vertical and horizontal stabs. The tail also appeared to be well built with the exception of a depression directly over the front and rear spars in the horizontal stabs. He explained that when he moved recently, that he had shot the plane with gray primer to protect it from the weather since he wouldn't have ready access to a shop to put it in right away. It ended up sitting out in the hot south Texas summer sun for a few weeks before he got a shop rented to work in. That caused the glass (or possibly the foam inside the horizontal stab) to swell, except that it held onto the spar, so it was slightly ballooned in front of and behind the spars. His recommendation was to fill it back smooth with micro.",
                "Second, understand that the dimensions called for in the plans put a twist in the sides that tends to work the panel in two directions of curvature. This twist makes the panel \"undevelopable\" meaning that that shape cannot be unrolled into an equivalent flat shape. This is important when laying out the side and bottom panels onto flat plywood. To illustrate this, try forming a piece of paper around a soda can. The paper can be formed flat around the can either straight or at a diagonal to it's length. It has only one direction of curvature and is by definition \"developable\". Now try to form the same piece of paper around a baseball. It won't lie flat on the surface without some deformation (folding, wrinkling or tearing) of the paper. The ball has curvature in more that one direction and is a \"compounded\" shape. Paper (or plywood) can only be readily formed in developable shapes as opposed to aluminum or other metal which can accept in plane deformation. A developable surface is needed to lay out a curved surface when the materials used can't be deformed with any degree of in-plane strain.\nInitially, the fuselage sides are laid out flat with reference to the top longeron measured to a straight chalk line. The bowing problem starts when the side panels are bent and sloped to form the fuselage box section. If the sides were not sloped (tumbled home), the section formed would be cylindrical and the longerons would lie flat. Since the sides are tumbled home, the section formed is now conical. When a conical shape is cut with a plane (building surface) not perpendicular to it's axis, the shape formed is elliptical -- exactly what happens with the top longeron. When it's built flat, bent to form a cylindrical section, and sloped to form a conical section, it takes on an elliptical shape firewall to tailstock.\nThis method borrows heavily from proven techniques used in the marine trades. It should be stressed at this point that although the layout procedure is not complicated, it is important to take your time. If the layout is not going well initially, start over! Better to erase layout errors now than to have them built it and cause surprises later.",
                "\"Scarfing\" is the practice of splicing plywood so that short pieces of plywood can be used to span long distances. On the KR, it is required on both the fuselage skins and spar webs. The angle of the splice should be 10 to 12 degrees to maintain strength across the joint. Also, joints should coincide with structural members, such as spar webs or fuselage truss members.\nThis scarfer is made by mating a regular plunge router (this one costs about $50) to a table saw. Obviously, you really only need a table saw to cut the chamfer, but it does make a nice heavy table for scarfing. You could just as easily use a large work table as the base.First, set the table saw for a 5.5 degree cut (for a 1:12 joint, or 6.5 degree cut for a 10:1 joint), and run a 1 x 6 through on edge to chamfer a corner on the board. Then drill the board for three router mounting holes (two are countersunk) and connect the assembly to the table saw with two 1/4 inch bolts. Use a long (2-3 inch) straight cutting bit to do the cutting. Adjust the bit so it doesn't interfere with your table top, and go to town. Keep pressure on the plywood to ensure contact with the table while you're scarfing. Make sure you feed your material from the same end as you would if you were sawing, or the router will take your plywood away from you and put a big dent in your garage door.\nIn the late 60's Ken Rand and Stuart Robinson were working as flight system engineers for Douglas Avionics. Ken was working as an electrical engineer, having previously worked for Sperry as an autopilots project engineer, while Stu's degree was in aeronautical engineering from Northrop University. They were two of the guys at the end of the DC-8,9, and 10 assembly lines responsible for correcting some of the nits and picks in various systems before delivery to the customer.",
                "Probably one of the most frustrating things about building experimental aircraft, especially when starting with a minimum of pre-fabricated parts, is to start building and ending up with an unexpected result. Every builder starts a new project by wanting it to go \"perfectly.\" So when things aren't going well, especially at the beginning, the frustration can lead to an unfinished airplane.\nThis is the first article in a series dedicated to helping builders of the Rand Robinson KR series planes build a straight and true fuselage -- the first part of the construction process. Borrowing from modern boatbuliding techniques, focus will be on the KR-2S, but the principles apply to the entire lineup of KR-1 & KR-2 series planes.\nWhile building the KR-2(s) a common surprise is encountered by builders when the completed fuselage sides are laid into position to form the fuselage box section. With many hours spent building the sides flat, finding the once straight longerons that now bow up from the building surface, form a most dissatisfying \"banana\" shape. Especially when using the preformed fiberglass parts, this curve in the top longeron is not acceptable. The builder is left wondering what went wrong and no amount of clamping or brute force forming will solve the problem to any degree of satisfaction. The problem is not the builder's fault. The solution starts by understanding the three dimensional relationship of the assembled parts being built.\nFirst understand that the plans show the finished form of the plane. They show the \"projected\" form as you would expect to see it if viewing an actual plane from the top, ends and from the side. Since the sides are sloped (flared) outward, looking from the side, the distances given by measuring the profile drawing are \"foreshortened\" and don't give the proper shape for building the fuselage with a flat top longeron. What needs to be done is to \"develop\" the \"true\" distances and shape of the flat panel so that when it is curved into position, the longerons lay flat.",
                "I also found a small linear crack in the lower left wing spar cap on the left wing stub. It appeared to be from over tightening the rear spar wing attach fitting bolts. His explanation was that the crack wasn't important because the rear spars only job is to keep the wings from folding back. I also noticed that the holes for attaching the outer wing to the wing stub were badly rounded out on the rear spar. He explained that the Diehl wing skins require the rear spar to be swept slightly more forward than the stock wings. This won't allow you to use the rear spar attach fittings from RR and that I would need to fabricate a new set of rear spar attach fittings.\nI also found that the aileron bellcranks were not built or installed as per plans, but found that they looked professional. I couldn't check for function since the right bellcrank and sheeve wasn't installed, the left wing also wasn't installed, and the right wing didn't exist yet.\nNext we pulled the inspection panels off of the fuselage and tail and looked at everything I could see with a good flashlight. I didn't find anything else that might be questionable about the fuselage except for a cracked elevator trim tab that was damaged when it fell off it's hanging place on the wall.\nNext we spent some time going over his builders log and builders photo album. I still hadn't seen anything that would dissuade me from buying this project.",
                "After the bulkheads were bondoed to the fuselage I used the stringers that I ripped from the 1x4s and bondoed them to the bulkheads. This gave me a male form to cover with thin plastic or posterboard. I stapled two layers of posterboard to the jig(thin plastic would work better). The posterboard wraps down two inches onto the fuselage. After I was satisfied with the way it looked, I then covered the entire thing with duct tape (fiberglass will not stick to duct tape) On top of this I wetout one layer of tri-ply cloth (22oz) that I had left over from an earlier project, and one layer of 8oz. bid. Remember to mask off your fuselage so you don't get epoxy on it. If you are not familiar with composite lay-ups, you should plan on razor cutting your lay-ups 4 to 6 hours after wetout while the lay-up is still soft enough to cut with a razorblade.\nAfter the lay-up cured (2 or 3 days) it was removed from the jig, and the jig was removed from the fuselage and discarded. (be careful, the bondo sticks very well to the spruce, you could splinter your wood during removal) I now have a fiberglass skin that tends to hold the shape of the jig but is still flexible enough to work with. I made two bulkheads out of 1/4 last-a-foam (AS&S) using the plywood formers from the jig as a guide. I covered these foam bulkheads with one 8oz layer of glass on each side, with a glass to glass edge on the bottom. After cure these bulkheads were bondoed into place (to the fuselage)and the fiberglass skin was pulled down tight and floxed to the bulkheads. When the flox cured the bondo joints were broken, again being careful not to harm the wood. The turtledeck was removed from the fuselage and 2 inch tapes added to the bulkheads inside and out.",
                "At each station, start by marking off each short (bottom longeron) line distance from the centerline. Use your set of trammels or beam compass for doing this. Mark the intersection of the short line with the station line.\nAt each station, mark off each long (top longeron) line distance from the intersection of the short line distance and the station line. Again the trammels or beam compass is best for completing this step. Mark the intersection of the long line distance with the station line.\nUsing the longeron as a batten, trace out the inside and outside curves of the longeron. After the batten is secure, in between each station, fasten a keeper block inside and outside to preserve the shape of the longeron taking care to avoid potential future interference with the diagonal members to be installed later. The fairing blocks can be removed or left in place if they won't interfere with building. The vertical station members and their diagonals can now be measured and positioned. Remember to refer to the plans for the material thickness direction.\nAfter vertical and diagonal members are cut and fitted, take time to draw their outlines on the building surface to cut down on time and confusion when laying out the opposite side.\nFinishing the side panel is accomplished in a manner similar to that called for in the handbook with the exception that the side and bottom skin panels will be attached later.\nThe next article in the series will discuss jigging and building techniques to ensure alignment and straightness of the flat built side panels. Also covered will be building a \"strongback\" jig to assure alignment of the side panels when they are formed into their final shape.\nPart 3 in the series will cover assembly of the side panels using the jigs. Some joint details will be discussed that will ensure a stronger and more fair fuselage assembly.

                "The author recounts various issues encountered while working on their aircraft's left wing, including delamination in the leading edge, unvarnished woodwork, an incorrectly installed aluminum drain fitting, misaligned front spar attach fittings, and a wobbly brake on the fuselage. They address these problems by sanding and rebuilding the leading edge, varnishing the woodwork, retapping the drain fitting, creating an aligning fixture for the spar fittings, and receiving a replacement set of wheels and brakes from the manufacturer.",
                "The inspection revealed significant issues with the left rear spar, including the rear spar attach fittings being installed backwards, a cracked spar cap, and improper modifications such as drilling holes through the spar and cutting out vertical braces. Additionally, the aileron bellcrank setup on the right side was found to be non-functional due to cable tension issues and interference with the rear wing attach fittings. These problems necessitated a major redesign or replacement of the rear spar and aileron system, highlighting the severity of the issues encountered during the inspection.",
                "The author had to make a quick decision on purchasing an aircraft project as their ride was leaving. They did a brief inspection of the wings and canopy, finding minor issues but nothing alarming. Believing they could fix any major problems and still come out ahead financially, they agreed to buy the project. They acknowledge potential oversight due to lack of local expertise in fiberglass, but later discovered several issues over the year, some due to ignorance and others from not inspecting closely enough. They then list some of the problems found and their corresponding fixes.",

                "The 2023 KR Forum included talks by Mike Stearns, Steve Trentman, and Bill Marcey. Stearns discussed internet resources for KR aircraft, showcased new wing skins, and mentioned his KR2S under construction. Trentman presented on his turbine engine installation, sourced from A7 attack jet starter engines, weighing 85 pounds and producing 90 horsepower. Les Palmer's KR2 N202LP won multiple awards at the 1995 KR Gathering, featuring a single-seater design with extended tail and stabilizer, Douglas fir fuselage, and a Dragonfly canopy.",
                "Les's custom KR2 aircraft features a cowling with NACA ducts, fiberglass parts made from female molds, and a reinforced firewall for a 200 lb Subaru EA-81 engine. The engine is equipped with a Holley carburetor, a PSRU with a 1.69:1 reduction ratio, and is air-conditioned. Originally a taildragger, it now has tricycle gear with custom aluminum wheels and Cleveland calipers. Cooling issues led to a radiator relocation, and an early flight test had a near-disaster due to a spark plug issue, but subsequent flights showed stable performance. The project began 20 years ago with a focus on building a KR-2 despite initial challenges.",
                "To ensure a fair and true fuselage, start by drawing a straight baseline on the building surface using a wire guide with 500 lbs. of tension. The baseline serves as a reference for the mid-point of the firewall, not the top longeron. Each station (vertical member) is laid out with calculated separation to match the plans when the panels are formed. The bottom and side panels are applied after forming the fuselage box section to ensure a straight shape. The firewall is laid out perpendicular to the baseline, with longitudinal and vertical dimensions marked off carefully. The top longeron is bowed outward, and stations are spaced slightly wider than specified in the plans, allowing the panels to fit correctly when formed into the box frame.",
                "Two individuals, Ken and Stu, aimed to create a fast, affordable, and easy-to-maintain airplane. They chose the Taylor Monoplane design but extensively modified it, keeping only the fuselage structure, airfoil, and powerplant. Ken tragically died in a KR2 crash, leaving his wife Jeanette to manage their company, Rans Designs (RR). Bill Marcy assists with engineering. Over 15,000 plan sets for KR1, KR2, and KR2S models have been sold, with 1200 KR2s and 5 KR2Ss currently flying. Builders often innovate, leading to modifications that sometimes become standard, such as the KR2S's enlarged cabin and Diehl wing skin.",
                "Three days after deciding to inspect a distant airplane project, the author flew 400 miles to the seller's location. Despite having extensive experience in airplane construction, particularly with tube and fabric designs, the author overlooked several issues during the inspection. The left wing used Dan Diehl wing skins, while the right wing skins were stored indoors. The fuselage, painted in primer gray, appeared well-built with meticulous interior woodwork and precise glasswork. However, a depression over the front and rear spars in the horizontal stabs was noted, caused by the fuselage sitting in the sun after being primed. The seller suggested filling the depression with micro, but this issue and others have required repairs in the year since the project was purchased.",
                "The text discusses the importance of understanding the curvature of panels in aircraft construction, particularly when dealing with \"undevelopable\" shapes that cannot be flattened without deformation. It explains that plywood, like paper, can only be easily formed into \"developable\" shapes with a single direction of curvature, unlike metals that can handle in-plane deformation. The example of wrapping paper around a soda can versus a baseball illustrates this concept. The text then describes the process of laying out fuselage sides, emphasizing the need to account for the sloped sides (tumbled home) that create a conical, rather than cylindrical, shape, resulting in an elliptical top longeron. The method is inspired by marine construction techniques, and the author stresses the importance of careful, accurate layout to avoid errors that could cause issues later in the build process.",
                "\"Scarfing\" is a technique used to splice plywood, allowing short pieces to span long distances. It is required on fuselage skins and spar webs on the KR, with a splice angle of 10 to 12 degrees for strength. Joints should align with structural members. A scarfer can be made by attaching a plunge router to a table saw, set at a 5.5 or 6.5 degree cut, using a 1 x 6 board and a 2-3 inch straight cutting bit. Apply pressure to the plywood during scarfing to maintain contact with the table. In the late 60's, Ken Rand and Stuart Robinson, both flight system engineers, were responsible for correcting issues in Douglas Avionics' DC-8, 9, and 10 aircraft before delivery.",

It focuses on the KR-2S but applies to the entire KR-1 & KR-2 lineup. A common issue builders face is the \"banana\" shape that occurs when the fuselage sides are assembled, despite the longerons being built flat. This happens because the plans show the projected form of the plane, not accounting for the sloped sides that require the longerons to be curved. The solution involves understanding the three-dimensional relationship of the parts and developing the true distances and shape of the flat panel to ensure the longerons lay flat when curved into position.",
                "The inspection of a partially completed aircraft revealed a small linear crack in the lower left wing spar cap, likely caused by overtightening the rear spar wing attach fitting bolts. The builder explained that the crack was not critical as the rear spars primarily prevent the wings from folding back. Additionally, the holes for attaching the outer wing to the wing stub were rounded out on the rear spar, requiring the fabrication of new rear spar attach fittings due to the Diehl wing skins' design. The aileron bellcranks were not built or installed as per plans but appeared professionally done, though function could not be assessed due to incomplete assembly. The fuselage inspection found no other issues except for a cracked elevator trim tab, which was damaged when it fell off the wall. Reviewing the builder's log and photo album did not raise any concerns about the project's quality.",
                "After attaching bulkheads to the fuselage with bondo, stringers were added to create a male form for covering. Two layers of posterboard were stapled to the form, and the entire structure was covered with duct tape. A layer of tri-ply cloth and an 8oz. bid were wetted out and applied, followed by curing for 2-3 days. The resulting fiberglass skin was removed from the jig and discarded. Two bulkheads made from 1/4\" last-a-foam were created using the jig's plywood formers as guides, and were covered with 8oz. glass on each side. These bulkheads were bondoed into place, and the fiberglass skin was pulled tight and floxed to them. After curing, the bondo joints were broken, and 2-inch tapes were added to the bulkheads inside and out.",

                    "The summaries revolve around the construction and modification of Rand Robinson KR series planes, particularly focusing on the KR-2S model but applicable to the entire KR-1 & KR-2 lineup. Key themes include:\n\n1. **Fuselage Construction Challenges**:\n   - Builders often encounter issues with the fuselage taking on a \"banana\" shape due to the misinterpretation of the plans, which show the projected form rather than accounting for the sloped sides that require curved longerons.\n   - The solution involves understanding the three-dimensional relationship of the parts and accurately laying out the true distances and shapes of the flat panels to ensure the longerons lay flat when curved into position.\n\n2. **Panel Curvature and Layout**:\n   - Plywood panels must be formed into \"developable\" shapes with a single direction of curvature, unlike metals that can handle in-plane deformation.\n   - The process of laying out fuselage sides requires careful consideration of the sloped sides (tumbled home) that create a conical shape, resulting in an elliptical top longeron.\n\n3. **Building Techniques and Tools**:\n   - Techniques such as drawing a straight baseline with a wire guide, laying out stations with calculated separation, and forming the fuselage box section before applying the bottom and side panels are crucial for ensuring a straight fuselage.\n   - \"Scarfing\" is a technique used to splice plywood, allowing short pieces to span long distances, which is essential for fuselage skins and spar webs.\n\n4. **Historical and Contextual Information**:\n   - Ken Rand and Stuart Robinson, both flight system engineers, were responsible for correcting issues in Douglas Avionics' DC-8, 9, and 10 aircraft before delivery.\n   - Ken and Stu aimed to create a fast, affordable, and easy-to-maintain airplane, leading to the development of the KR series. Ken's tragic death in a KR2 crash resulted in his wife, Jeanette, managing their company, Rans Designs (RR).\n\n5. **Community and Innovations**:\n   - The KR Forum in 2023 featured talks on various topics, including internet resources for KR aircraft, new wing skins, turbine engine installations, and notable KR2 modifications.\n   - Builders often innovate, leading to modifications that sometimes become standard, such as the KR2S's enlarged cabin and Diehl wing skin.\n\nOverall, the summaries highlight the technical challenges and innovative solutions in constructing and modifying KR series planes, as well as the historical context and community involvement in the development of these aircraft.",

Then we went in front of the White House,. There were barricades set up in front of white house fence. So when we got there, we jumped over barricades and were able to get right next to the White House fence.\" Participant Linda LeTendre (Daily Gazette) reports: At the end of the rally, before the silent, solemn procession to the White House fence, in honor of those killed in Iraq and Afghan wars of lies and deceptions, the VFP played taps and folded an American flag that had been left behind at a recent funeral for the veteran of one of those wars. Two attendees in full dress uniform held and folded the flag. I had the image of all of the people who stood along the roads and bridges when the bodies of the two local men, Benjamin Osborn and David Miller, were returned to the Capital District. I thought if all of those people were here now or spoke out against war these two fine young men might still be with us.I was blessed enough to be held in custody with one of those in uniform; a wonderful young man who had to move from his hometown in Georgia because no one understood why as a veteran he was against these wars.

People came from as far as Riverside to protest, braving what Southern California media outlets have dubbed the \"storm of the decade.\" The demonstration, initiated and led by the ANSWER Coalition, broke the routine of holiday shopping and garnered support from activists and even passers by, who joined in chanting \"Money for jobs and education -- not for war and occupation!\" and \"Occupation is a crime -- Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine!\" Protesters held banners reading, \"U.S./NATO Out of Afghanistan!\" and \"Yes to jobs, housing and education -- no to war, racism and occupation!\"Speakers at the demonstration included representatives of Korean Americans for Peace, ANSWER Coalition, KmB Pro-People Youth, Veterans for Peace, Party for Socialism and Liberation and National Lawyers Guild. Tuesday, Nouri al-Maliki managed to put away the political stalemate thanks to a lot of Scotch -- tape to hold the deal together and booze to keep your eyes so crossed you don't question how someone can claim to have formed a Cabinet when they've left over ten positions to be filled at a later date.

Aseel Kami (Reuters) notes one of the most damning aspects of Nouri's chosen men -- a man is heaing the Ministry of Women's Affairs. Iraqiya's spokesperson Maysoon Damluji states, \"There are really good women who could do wel . . . they cannot be neglected and marginalized.\" Al-Amal's Hanaa Edwar states, \"They call it a national (power) sharing government. So where is the sharing? Do they want to take us back to the era of the harem? Do they want to take us back to the dark ages, when women were used only for pleasure.\" Deborah Amos (NPR's All Things Considered) reports that a struggle is going on between secular impulses and fundamentalist ones. Gallery owner Qasim Sabti states, \"We know it's fighting between the religious foolish man and the civilization man. We know we are fighting like Gandhi, and this is a new language in Iraqi life. We have no guns. We do not believe in this kind of fighting.\" Deborah Amos is the author of Eclipse of the Sunnis: Power, Exile, and Upheaval in the Middle East. Meanwhile Nizar Latif (The National) reports that distrust is a common reaction to the new government in Baghdad and quotes high school teacher Hussein Abed Mohammad stating, \"Promises were made that trustworthy, competent people would be ministers this time around, but it looks as if everything has just been divided out according to sectarian itnerests. No attention has been paid to forming a functioning government, it is just a political settlement of vested interests. I'm sure al Maliki will have the same problems in his next four years as he had in the last four years.\" Days away from the ten months mark, Nouri managed to finally end the stalemate. Some try to make sense of it and that must have been some office party that the editorial board of the Washington Post is still coming down from judging by \"A good year in Iraq.\" First up,",

No waiting until he hit the ground to announce he was going to Iraq -- the way George The Bully Boy Bush had to and the way US President Barack Obama still has to. In the lead up to Santa's yearly visit, many 'authorities' in Iraq began insisting that Christmas couldn't be celebrated publicly, that even Santa was banned. Gabriel Gatehouse (BBC News) quotes Shemmi Hanna stating, \"I wasn't hurt but I wish that I had been killed. I wish I had become a martyr for this church, but God kept me alive for my daughters.\" Shemmi Hanna was in Our Lady of Salvation Church in Baghdad when it was assaulted October 31st and she lost her husband, her son, her daughter-in-law and her infant grandson in the attack. The October 31st attack marks the latest wave of violence targeting Iraqi Christians. The violence has led many to flee to northern Iraq (KRG) or to other countries. Zvi Bar'el (Haaretz) notes, \"This week the Iraqi legislature discussed the Christians' situation and passed a resolution in principle to help families who fled. However, the parliament does not know where the Christians are, how many are still in Iraq, in their homes, and how many have found asylum in Iraqi Kurdistan.\" John Leland (New York Times) reports:The",

The story begs for more than it offers. The most obvious observation is: what does it say that a woman's allegedly killed by her father and no one says a word for over a month? After that, it should probably be noted that there are many men in Iraq killing women who, no doubt, would love to also be able to pin the blame on al Qaida. In other violence, Reuters notes a house bombing in Haswa which claimed the life of Mohammed al-Karrafi, \"his wife, two sons and a nephew\" -- as well as injuring four more people, and a Samarra roadside bombing which claimed the lives of 2 police officers. DPA notes it was two homes bombed in Haswa and that the Samarra roadside bombing also injured four Iraqi soldiers.

Chaos and violence continue, Iraqi women make clear their displeasure over the Cabinet make up, Daniel Ellsberg and Veterans for Peace get some recognition, and more. Last Thursday a protest held outside the White House. One of the organizers was Veterans for Peace and Pentagon Papers whistle blower Daniel Ellsberg participated and spoke. Juana Bordas (Washington Post) advocates for both of them to be named persons of the year: Veterans for Peace and Daniel Ellsberg should be this year's person of the year because of their courage and bravery to stand up for all of us who believe that \"war is not the answer.\" Moreover in a time of economic recession, the war machine is bankrupting our country. As John Amidon, a Marine Corps veteran from Albany asked at the White House protest, \"How is the war economy working for you?\"While unemployment rates hover near 10 percent, there is no doubt that the U.S. economy and quality of life is faltering. Worldwide we are 14th in education, 37th in the World Health Organization's ranking on medical systems, and 23rd in the U.N. Environmental Sustainability Index on being most livable and greenest benefits. There is one place we take the undeniable world lead. The US military spending accounts for a whopping 46.5 percent of world military spending--the next ten countries combined come in at only 20.7 percent.

Meyassr al-Qaspotros told the Christmas Eve crowd at the Sacred Church of Jesus, a Chaldean Catholic church. \"We do not want to leave the country because we will leave an empty space.\" Raheem Salman (Los Angeles Times) reports, \"Rimon Metti's family will go to Christian services on Christmas Day, but his relatives will be praying for their own survival and wondering whether this is their last holiday season in Baghdad. If they had any grounds for optimism about the future of their faith in Iraq, it vanished this year amid repeated attacks on fellow believers.\" Shahsank Bengali (McClatchy Newspapers) adds, \"Nearly two months after a shocking assault by Islamist militants, Our Lady of Salvation Catholic Church will commemorate Christmas quietly, with daytime mass and prayers for the dead, under security fit more for a prison than a house of worship. It is the same at Christian churches across Baghdad and northern Iraq, where what's left of one of the world's oldest Christian communities prepares to mark perhaps the most somber Christmas since the start of the Iraq war.\"Meanwhile Taylor Luck (Jordan Times) reports on Iraqi refugees in Jordan:Although the calendar will say December 25, for Theresa, Saturday will not be Christmas. There will be no cinnamon klecha cooling on the dining room table, no outdoor ceramic nativity scene, no readings of hymns with relatives. The 63-year-old Iraqi woman has even refused to put up Christmas lights in the crowded two-room Amman hotel apartment she has called home since fleeing Baghdad last month.\"There is no holiday spirit. All we have is fear,\" she said.This holiday will instead mark another year without news from her 46-year-old son, who was kidnapped outside Baghdad in late 2006.From Turkey, Sebnem Arsu (New York Times -- link has text and video) notes the increase in Iraq refugees to the country since October 31st and quotes Father Emlek stating, \"I've never seen as many people coming here as I have in the last few weeks. They also go to Lebanon, Jordan and Syria",
                "stringing the country along for ten months while no decisions could go through. The editorial board of the Washington Post, for example, was full of praise yesterday. Today they're joined by Iran's Ambassador to Iraq, Hassan Danaiifar. The Tehran Times reports that Danaiifar was full of praise today hailing the \"positive and final step which ended the 10-month political limbo in Iraq.\" However, Danaiifar was less pie-in-the-sky than the Post editorial board because he can foresee future problems as evidenced by his statement, \"We may witness the emergence of some problems after one and half of a year -- for example, some ministers may be impeached.\" Of course, there are already many clouds on the horizon, even if Iranian diplomats and Post editorial boards can't suss them out. For example, Ben Bendig (Epoch Times) noted the objection of Iraq's female politicians to Nouri al-Maliki's decision to nominate only one woman (so far) to his Cabinet: \"Some 50 female lawmakers went to the country's top leadership, the United Nations and the Arab League to voice their concern and desire for increased representation.\" BNO notes that protest and also that a group of Iraqi MPs are alleging that Iraqiya bought seats in the Cabinet via money exchanged in Jordan. UPI adds, \"Maliki, a Shiite who has a long history of working with Tehran, has named himself acting minister of defense, interior and national security, three most powerful and sensitive posts in the government he is stitching together. Although Maliki appears to be bending over backward to accommodate rivals among Iraq's Shiite majority as well as minority Sunnis and Kurds in his administration in a spirit of reconciliation, he is unlikely to relinquish those ministries that dominate the security sector.\" DPA reports, \"Sheikh Abdel-Mahdi al-Karbalaei, a confident of influential Shiite spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, said that the new cabinet is 'below the standards' Iraqi citizens had hoped for and suggested it could prove to be weaker than the previous government.\" Ranj Alaaldin (Guardian) also spots clouds on the horizon:Lasting peace and stability depends on resolving outstanding disputes with the Kurds on oil, revenue-sharing, security and the disputed territories (Kirkuk in particular). The Kurds, rather than exploiting their kingmaker position to take a stronger proportion of ministries in Baghdad (they are taking just one major",
                "major contention aside, the enactment of the bill might be an institutional step forward in the fight for \"equality\"; however institutions rarely reflect reality.Do we really think that the US congress vote to repeal the act and Obama signing the bill is going to stop the current systemic harassment of gays in the military?While I am a staunch advocate for equality of marriage and same-sex partnership, I cannot - as a peace activist - rejoice in the fact that now homosexuals can openly serve next to heterosexuals in one of the least socially responsible organisations that currently exists on earth: The US military.It is an organisation tainted with a history of intolerance towards anyone who isn't a Caucasian male from the Mid-West. Even then I'm sure plenty fitting that description have faced the terror and torment enshrined into an institution that transforms the pride and enthusiasm of youth into a narrow zeal for dominating power relations.And we'll close with this from Francis A. Boyle's \"2011: Prospects for Humanity?\" (Global Research):Historically, this latest eruption of American militarism at the start of the 21st Century is akin to that of America opening the 20th Century by means of the U.S.-instigated Spanish-American War in 1898. Then the Republican administration of President William McKinley stole their colonial empire from Spain in Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines; inflicted a near genocidal war against the Filipino people; while at the same time illegally annexing the Kingdom of Hawaii and subjecting the Native Hawaiian people (who call themselves the Kanaka Maoli) to near genocidal conditions. Additionally, McKinley's military and colonial expansion into the Pacific was also designed to secure America's economic exploitation of China pursuant to the euphemistic rubric of the \"open door\" policy. But over the next four decades America's aggressive presence, policies, and practices in the \"Pacific\" would ineluctably pave the way for Japan's attack at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 194l, and thus America's precipitation into the ongoing Second World War. Today a century later the serial imperial aggressions launched and menaced by the Republican Bush Jr. administration and now the Democratic Obama administration are threatening to set off World War III. By shamelessly exploiting the terrible tragedy of 11 September 2001, the Bush Jr. administration set forth to steal a hydrocarbon empire from the Muslim states and peoples living in Central Asia and the Persian Gulf under the bogus pretexts of (1) fighting a",
                "but it seems that Turkey is the most popular despite the fact that they do not speak the language.\" Jeff Karoub (AP) reports on the small number of Iraqi refugees who have made it to the US and how some of them \"struggle with insomnia, depression and anxiety.\"One group in Iraq who can openly celebrate Christmas are US service members who elect to. Barbara Surk (AP) reports that tomorrow Chief Warrant Officer Archie Morgan will celebrate his fourth Christmas in Iraq and Captain Diana Crane is celebrating her second Christmas in Iraq: \"Crane was among several dozen troops attending a Christmas Eve mass in a chapel in Camp Victory, an American military base just outside Baghdad.\" Marc Hansen (Des Moines Reigster) speaks with six service members from Iowa who are stationed in Iraq. Sgt 1st Class Dennis Crosser tells Hansen, \"I certainly understand from reading the paper what's going on in Afghanistan and the attention definitely needs to be on the troops there. But everyone serving here in Operation New Dawn appreciates a little bit of attention as we finish this up.\"Today Jiang Yu, China's Foreign Minister, issued the following statement, \"We welcome and congratulate Iraq on forming a new government. We hope that the Iraqi Government unite all its people, stabilize the security situation, accelerate economic reconstruction and make new progress in building its country.\" James Cogan (WSWS) reports:US State Department official Philip Crowley declared on Wednesday that Washington had not \"dictated the terms of the government\". In reality, constant American pressure was applied to Maliki, Allawi, Kurdish leaders and other prominent Iraqi politicians throughout the entire nine-month process to form a cabinet. The US intervention included numerous personal phone calls and visits to Baghdad by both President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden.The key objective of the Obama administration has been to ensure that the next Iraqi government will \"request\" a long-term military partnership with the US when the current Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) expires at the end of 2011. The SOFA is the legal basis upon which some 50,000 American troops remain in Iraq, operating from large strategic air bases such as Balad and Tallil and Al Asad. US imperialism spent billions of dollars establishing these advanced bases as part of its wider strategic plans and has no intention of abandoning them.Cogan's only the second person to include the SOFA in his report. Some are impressed with the 'feat' of taking nearly ten months to form a government,",
                "war against international terrorism; and/or (2) eliminating weapons of mass destruction; and/or (3) the promotion of democracy; and/or (4) self-styled \"humanitarian intervention.\" Only this time the geopolitical stakes are infinitely greater than they were a century ago: control and domination of two-thirds of the world's hydrocarbon resources and thus the very fundament and energizer of the global economic system \u2013 oil and gas. The Bush Jr./ Obama administrations have already targeted the remaining hydrocarbon reserves of Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia for further conquest or domination, together with the strategic choke-points at sea and on land required for their transportation. In this regard, the Bush Jr. administration announced the establishment of the U.S. Pentagon's Africa Command (AFRICOM) in order to better control, dominate, and exploit both the natural resources and the variegated peoples of the continent of Africa, the very cradle of our human species. This current bout of U.S. imperialism is what Hans Morgenthau denominated \"unlimited imperialism\" in his seminal work Politics Among Nations (4th ed. 1968, at 52-53): The outstanding historic examples of unlimited imperialism are the expansionist policies of Alexander the Great, Rome, the Arabs in the seventh and eighth centuries, Napoleon I, and Hitler. They all have in common an urge toward expansion which knows no rational limits, feeds on its own successes and, if not stopped by a superior force, will go on to the confines of the political world. This urge will not be satisfied so long as there remains anywhere a possible object of domination--a politically organized group of men which by its very independence challenges the conqueror's lust for power. It is, as we shall see, exactly the lack of moderation, the aspiration to conquer all that lends itself to conquest, characteristic of unlimited imperialism, which in the past has been the undoing of the imperialistic policies of this kind\u2026. On 10 November 1979 I visited with Hans Morgenthau at his home in Manhattan. It proved to be our last conversation before he died on 19 July 1980. Given his weakened physical but not mental condition and his serious heart problem, at the end of our necessarily abbreviated one-hour meeting I purposefully asked him what he thought about the future of international relations. iraqbbc newsgabriel gatehousethe new york timesjohn lelandhaaretzzvi bar'elthe"

The latter environment being larger, we increase the mission time and the depth of the search tree in POMCP from T max = 30 (Map 1 and Map 2) to T max = 60 (Map 3).\nWe do not notice an increase in the time required to update the robot's belief with an increase in problem complexity, which is consistent with our observation that the complexity of the Bayesian update should not increase with the number of obstacles or polytopes. On the contrary, the belief update time on Map 2 and Map 3, containing more obstacles, is reduced compared to the first map.\nMore obstacles result in fewer iterations when solving the constrained shortest path problem with A . Adding constraints due to the obstacles and polytopes reduces the size of the A search tree. C. Limitations Simulation environments. In our simulations, we hardcoded the preference policy over the maps (e.g. in Map 1, go around the table counter-clockwise).\nWe randomly sampled problem instances (start and goal locations, and goal options) to reduce the bias introduced by these preference choices. To best evaluate and compare the different approaches, it would be best to sample preferences among a distribution of preferences chosen by a human (for example, from benchmarks resulting from a collection of data).\nCreating such a benchmark is an interesting direction for future work. Hyperplane arrangement construction. The main limitation of our approach is that the size and geometry of each polytope depends strongly on the geometry of the obstacles, as seen in fig. . Because of this, the robot can make predictions over preferences that are too refined compared with the topology of the environment.\nA direct consequence is that when the size of the polytopes is small, the information provided by the human can be incorrectly interpreted as a preference on the robot's immediate action. Our method can be improved by changing the structure of the hyperplane arrangement so that it relies on the topology of the environment, but does not vary strongly with the geometry of the features in the environment.",

                "Collaboration between humans and robots has become increasingly important and one key aspect of this collaboration is the ability for robots to adapt to human decisions. In many scenarios, such as a robot navigating through a busy room to deliver an item, it is important for the robot to take into account human preferences.\nFor instance, humans may prefer a specific path that would allow their colleagues to notice the item being delivered, but this preference may change dynamically based on various factors such as changes in the environment or unforeseen circumstances. While some preferences can be incorporated into the path-planning process, accommodating dynamic user preferences in real-time remains challenging.\nIn this paper, we propose a way to enable robots to adapt to human preferences dynamically by leveraging real-time feedback to inform decision-making. In this work, we tackle the problem of robot navigation in which the robot cannot observe the goal or the preferred path to the goal, but must make navigation decisions that are influenced by humans through recommended actions.\nPrior work has explored how to adapt to a human's preference through feedback, but such approaches often require a high level of intervention, which can be time-consuming and impractical in real-world scenarios. To optimize the use of human input and quickly infer the human's preference, Fig. : An autonomous robot navigates in a simulated classroom towards a goal location (pink circle).\nAt the start of its mission, it receives direction indications (arrows) from a human that indicate which path it should take to get to the goal. In this scenario, the human wants the robot to go around the desks on the right side of the classroom. A robot that does not reason over path preferences (green) will take the shortest path to the goal regardless of the human's input.\nOur method (blue) infers the human's path preference from these indications and adapts to their recommendations. we propose an approach that leverages probabilistic representations of human preference and incorporates real-time feedback. Previous research by Bajcsy et al. considered an online adaptation problem in a manipulation task, where the person can apply forces to the robot to indicate their preferences.",

                "We can notice that by introducing this assumption, we removed the direct relationship between the number of polytopes in the environment and the complexity of the Bayesian update in eq. ( ). In practice, components of \u03b8 are not mutually independent. For example, if the human preference at a vertex v 1 is\n, it is unlikely that the human will also prefer p v2 = (v 2 , v 1 ) (turning back). We can improve our model by assuming a dependent relationship between preferences for adjacent edges, which does not significantly increase the complexity of the inference problem. An interesting property of our encoding is that any two paths that belong to different homotopy classes will cross different sequences of polytopes, i.e. they correspond to a different sequence of edges on G.\nThis can be proved by contradiction. Let us suppose that two continuous trajectories \u03be 1 and \u03be 2 , with the same start and end points and that do not intersect any obstacle, traverse the same regions in G in the same order. From the construction of the hyperplane arrangement, each polytope that the paths traverse through is obstacle-free.\nTherefore, within each polytope, there is no obstacle in the area located in between the portions of \u03be 1 and \u03be 2 that belong to the region. A smooth transformation of \u03be 1 into \u03be 2 can be obtained by transforming each portion of \u03be 1 belonging to the polytopes it intersects into the corresponding portion of \u03be 2 for the same polytopes, where the extremities of the trajectory portions are connected to one another along the polytope's edges (where the same edge is crossed by both paths).\nAlong this transformation, the paths do not intersect any obstacle, and therefore \u03be 1 and \u03be 2 belong to the same homotopy class.",

Because our representation of the world is discrete, the arbitration is given by a step function.\nDenoted by U , the action corresponding to the human's input, and P , the robot's prediction for the optimal action, we write the policy where we chose h = 1.6 as the confidence threshold.\n\nResults",
                "In this section, we provide a definition of preference \u03b8 according to a graphical representation of the environment based on the hyperplane arrangement. Under this representation, a path preference corresponds to a set of preferred transitions. In other words, for each polytope in the space, the human will have a preference to which neighboring polytope they wish to transition.\nLet G := (V, E) be an undirected graph, where vertices are obstacle-free polytopes, and edges connect two adjacent polytopes. Each polytope is described by a unique vector \u03b1 j as defined in eq. ( ). Two polytopes are adjacent if they share non-redundant constraints (rows in eq. ( )) corresponding to the same hyperplane (i.e. they are on opposite sides of the hyperplane).\nLet N (v) be the set of neighbors of a vertex v. For each vertex, we denote p v the discrete-valued random variable describing which edge in N (v) the human intends to transition to. Using this formalism, we define a path preference as the set of preferred transitions over all nodes in the graph, Let m \u03b8 = v\u2208V |N (v)| be the cardinality of \u0398, and m g = |\u2126 g | the number of possible goals.\nA priori, the number of Bayesian updates required to update the belief at every iteration should be m \u03b8 \u00d7 m g . Now, let us assume the conditional independence relationships described by the new problem diagram in fig. . More specifically, we introduce the assumption that conditioned on a robot location s t , the goal g, and the preference for the corresponding vertex p v in the graph, the observation o t and the preference for any other vertex are conditionally independent.\nIn other words, the observations the human provides can be defined conditioned only on the robot location, the goal, and the human's preference for its current vertex p v . By introducing this assumption, each update step only requires updating the joint (p v , g), reducing the number of cost computations to |N (v)| \u00d7 m g .",
                "By allowing the robot to continue its task while taking into account a probabilistic representation of human preference, their approach does not require frequent inputs. Building on this idea, we adopt a similar approach to adapt to a human's preference in the context of a robot autonomously navigating through a known environment, such as a cluttered office space.\nSpecifically, we focus on allowing the human to influence the robot's trajectory with respect to obstacles, by providing guidance on preferred routes or paths, while the robot continues to execute its task. Paths can be represented using homotopy classes . However, homotopies can pose computational challenges when used to encode and infer human preferences.\nWhen the robot maintains a belief over homotopy classes, the inference problem can become exponentially complex with the number of obstacles in the space. Additionally, when the goal is unknown, the number of variables increases with the number of candidate destinations. This complexity can render the decision-making problem intractable.\nOur solution is to encode path preference based on a partitioning of the environment into polytopes . This representation allows path preferences to be expressed as sets of preferred transitions between adjacent polytopes. Paths belonging to different homotopy classes correspond to different sequences of transitions.\nBy leveraging conditional independence assumptions, we can make the Bayesian inference problem tractable. These assumptions exploit the fact that human actions provide information about the path in a piece-wise manner. For example, indicating a preference for navigating around a particular obstacle only provides information about the local area and not the entire path.\nFinally, after updating its belief representation over the human's preference, the robot can adapt to indications by replanning online. Our contributions are as follows. \u2022 We formulate the human-robot collaboration problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) where both the goal of the task and the human's path preference are unknown random variables.\n\u2022 We propose an encoding of a human's path preference using a partitioning of the environment into polytopes, along with conditional independence assumptions that make the Bayesian inference problem tractable to infer the task goal and path preference online. \u2022 Through simulations in two environments of different sizes and complexity, we show that our method is effective for solving problems where the robot must reach a goal that is unknown a-priori while simultaneously adapting to a human's indications.",
                "Planning with homotopy class constraints is useful in problems where the robot's requirements are given with respect to obstacles, and Yi, Goodrich, and Seppi consider topological constraints provided by human operators. Bhattacharya propose an efficient algorithm for solving pathplanning problems under homotopic constraints.\nHowever, the number of homotopy classes for a given problem can be infinite, and as the robot changes location and updates its representation of the world, carrying out inference over homotopy classes in a dynamic environment requires recomputing the set of homotopies at every iteration, making the belief update challenging.\nPrior work has addressed the challenge of shared autonomy by considering how robots can infer a human's intended goal, or how they can infer the preferred path to a goal. However, we argue that inferring the goal and the path as separate problems can lead to over-confidence in incorrect beliefs about the user's preferences.\nTo illustrate this point, consider the following scenario: a robot and a human are collaborating to move an object from one end of a room to Fig. : Using the hyperplanes composing the H-representation of each obstacle, we construct a hyperplane arrangement of the obstacle-free space (a). We define the human's preference for the robot's one step action choices as the posterior distribution (given all human input up to that point) over transitions from the current to the neighboring polytopes, i.e. edges on the graph.\nEach time the robot transitions to a new polytope, the set of neighbor polytopes and the distribution over human preferences are updated. another, but there is an obstacle in the way. The human would like the robot to take a path around the obstacle on the left, even though the goal is on the right. If the robot only infers the goal from the human's inputs, it may incorrectly assume that the goal is on the right, and become over-confident in this belief.\nOn the other hand, if the robot only infers the preferred path, it may mistakenly assume that the goal is on the left, leading to a failure in completing the task. To overcome these challenges, our work proposes a joint inference approach that considers both the human's intended goal and their preferred path to that goal.",

To overcome this challenge, we propose a method for encoding and inferring path preference online using a partitioning of the space into polytopes. Our approach enables joint inference over the goal and path preference using a stochastic observation model for the human.\nWe evaluate our method on an unknown-goal navigation problem with sparse human interventions, and find that it outperforms baseline approaches as the human's inputs become increasingly sparse. We find that the time required to update the robot's belief does not increase with the complexity of the environment, which makes our method suitable for online applications.\n\nINTRODUCTION",
                "We further assume that having chosen a goal and path preference, the human takes actions to noisily minimize a cost function C g,\u03b8 that measures the cost of moving from the robot's current location to the goal along the preferred path. For example, C g,\u03b8 (s t , o t ) can be the length of the shortest path from location s t to the goal g after taking a first step to o t , and constrained by path preference \u03b8.\nWe use C g,\u03b8 to induce a probability distribution over observations, given by: where \u03b3 h is a hyperparameter that designates the rationality coefficient. This model assumes the human will pick the lowest cost action with the highest probability and the likelihood of an action decreases exponentially with the increase in cost .\nOur inclusion of the path preference \u03b8 sets our approach apart from . The model is shown in fig. represented as a Bayesian Network.",
                "EXPERIMENTS\n\nWe evaluate our model on a simulated navigation task where the robot must reach a goal that is unknown a priori while respecting the path preferences indicated by a human. The robot navigates in a grid world containing obstacles. The transition model is deterministic: the robot selects an adjacent location on the grid to reach at the next time step.\nThe robot is also allowed to take diagonal actions. Each location s t in the map can be mapped to a vertex v t \u2208 G. Therefore, the actions leading to locations mapped to different vertices correspond to edges on the graph. We note f (s t , a t ) the edge crossed by taking action a t from location s t .\nThe robot is given a mission time limit T max for reaching the goal. In this problem, we assume that the human selects actions to noisily minimize a cost function C g,\u03b8 , where \u03b8 is defined as per eq. ( ), corresponding to the length of the shortest path to the goal constrained by the preference (where the robot is only allowed to make transitions on G along preferred edges).\nMore specifically, where \u03b4(s t , g | o t , p vt ) designates the length of the shortest path from s t to g passing by o t and constrained by preference p vt . This is a slight variant of the cost function proposed by Best and Fitch , where we add in a conditioning on the path preference. We compute costs by running the A path planning algorithm on the environment maps (grid worlds with diagonal actions) and impose preference constraints by pruning invalid transitions from the search tree.\nReward model. At each step in time, the robot receives a reward which is a sum of three components: a goal-specific reward a preference-specific reward or penalty We compute solutions to the POMDP defined in section III-B with the online solver POMCP , and with the particularity that within the rollouts, the robot does not expect to collect human inputs.\nEach time a solution is computed, the robot takes an action and may receive an observation. If it does, it updates its belief distribution over the unknown problem variables and resolves the POMDP over a receding horizon.\n\nBaselines",
                "Our method shows higher success rates compared to baseline approaches when the human inputs are sparse. Our approach enables a robot to make effective navigation decisions in collaboration with a human, even when the goal and path preference are not known in advance, and with minimal human input. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in shared autonomy and interactive systems, where humans and robots work together to accomplish tasks.\nSeveral approaches have been proposed to address the challenge of enabling effective collaboration between human and robot agents while still achieving high task performance. Losey et al. and Jeon, Losey, and Sadigh propose a framework where a human operator is given control of a task-relevant latent action space while an autonomous system handles the rest.\nDragan and Srinivasa present a formalism for arbitrating between a user's input and a robot's policy when both human and robot share control of the same action space. Cognetti et al. [7] provide a method for real-time modifications of a path, . . . Fig. : We model the intent inference problem with the above diagram.\nAt each step in time, the robot receives an observation ot from the human conditioned on its current location st, the intended goal g, and the human's path preference \u03b8. The robot updates its belief over g and \u03b8 and transitions to a next location st+1. while Hagenow et al. present a method that allows an outside agent to modify key robot state variables and blends the changes with the original control.\nHowever, a common challenge of these approaches is the high level of intervention required from humans. Best and Fitch propose a method for predicting an agent's intended trajectory from observations. Rather than maintaining a belief over the agent's future path, they infer the agent's intended goal among a set of candidate locations at the boundary of the space.\nThis approach provides information on where the agent is heading and generates a distribution of candidate future trajectories for the agent. Inferring the goal of the task among a discrete set of candidates is also relevant to the area of shared autonomy. Javdani, Srinivasa, and Bagnell propose a formalism for shared control of a robotic arm, where the robot must assist the human in picking up an object but needs to infer which object the human has chosen from joystick inputs.",
                "Specifically, we model the human's preference over different homotopy classes and leverage a conditional independence assumption to provide a tractable solution. In our approach, we assume that the human's inputs are noisily rational conditioned on both the goal and the preference. By jointly inferring the goal and path preference, we can avoid over-confidence in incorrect beliefs about the user's preferences, leading to improved system performance.\nWe consider the problem of robot navigation in a known environment to an unknown destination, where a human can intervene and provide a heading direction to the robot using a joystick or force cues. The human also has a preference on which path the robot should take with respect to obstacles, and our objective is for the robot to understand the human's intentions and execute the task with minimal interventions.\nLet g be a discrete random variable denoting the goal of the task, belonging to a set of candidates \u2126 g , and let \u03b8 be a discrete-valued random variable representing the human's path preference, belonging to a set of possible preferences \u0398. The physical location of the robot at time index t is denoted by s t \u2208 R 2 , and the robot's action at time index t, belonging to some action space A, is denoted by a t .\nThe transition model T (s t+1 | s t , a t ) is deterministic, meaning the robot has full control over its future location. At any time step, the human may provide an observation to the robot. When the human intervenes, the robot receives a direction (heading angle) that can be mapped to a future location in space.\nMore specifically, we map the direction to an intended location, which is the resulting robot location after advancing in the indicated direction for one time step. For simplicity, we consider that the robot directly makes an observation o t of the location indicated by the human. We assume that the robot has a stochastic observation model for the human P (o t | s t , g, \u03b8) that is conditioned on both the goal of the task g and the human's preferred path \u03b8.",
                "When evaluating the algorithm, we consider that a run is successful if the robot reached the goal within its allocated mission time T max and only made transitions between graph vertices corresponding to the human's preferences. We vary the time delay between human inputs, from constant guidance (\u2206 T = 1) to only a single observation (\u2206 T \u2265 T max ).\nSuccess rates. Table I reports the success rates for experiments conducted over six randomly sampled problem instances and 50 runs per instance in Map 1 (fig. ). When the human provides inputs at every iteration, the compliant policy shows the highest success rates. However, as \u2206 T increases, the compliant robot is not able to accomplish the task within the allotted time as it does not receive sufficient inputs to do so, and performance decreases compared to the autonomous baselines.\nWe find that in these runs, accounting for path preference consistently improves performance compared with the goal-only baseline. Results also show that blending the user's input with the robot's policy (Path Preference + Blend) when the human provides information leads to improved performance. Belief entropy.\nFigure shows a challenging problem instance where the directions the human provides do not align directly with the shortest path to the goal. By ignoring the effects of preferences in the problem model (goal only), the robot quickly infers from observations that the upper left goal is less likely than others (P (g) drops).\nThe strong decrease in entropy shows that the robot becomes overconfident in this prediction. Overconfidence in an incorrect goal will prevent the agent from finding the correct goal once the human's indications directly align with it, as it needs to correct for the wrong predictions, as shown in the path realization (fig.\n). In this realization, the goal-only method (green robot) fails to search the upper left area within the allotted time. By accounting for path preferences in its model, the blue robot's entropy over the goal distribution decreases more steadily, allowing for it to leverage the human's latest observations and reach the goal successfully.\nshows an over-confident prediction (shown by the strong reduction in belief entropy) that the correct goal is less likely, making it more difficult to reach the correct goal compared to a method that accounts for path preference.

The number of updates is proportional to the product of possible goals and preferences. To manage computational complexity, the text proposes encoding preferences using hyperplane arrangements, which partition the environment into regions and define preferred transitions between them. This approach aims to avoid exponential growth in computations as the number of obstacles increases. The decision-making process is framed as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where the goal is to find an optimal policy that maximizes expected future rewards.",
                        "The text discusses a two-dimensional environment with multiple polytopic obstacles, each defined by their half-space representation (H-representation). The environment is partitioned into polytopes using a hyperplane arrangement. Each polytope has a specific H-representation that indicates the relative position of points within it with respect to the hyperplanes of the obstacles. The text also mentions the possibility of reducing the H-representation by removing redundant constraints, resulting in a simplified representation that includes only the non-redundant constraints corresponding to the polytope's edges.",
                        "The text discusses a method for identifying nonredundant constraints in a polytope, which is a geometric object defined by intersecting hyperplanes. As a robot moves through space, the first hyperplane it crosses upon exiting the polytope corresponds to one of its nonredundant constraints. Vincent and Schwager propose an iterative approach using linear programming to remove redundant constraints. This method is applied to compute a vector \u03b1 j e for each polytope, where \u03b1 j e \u2208 {\u22121, 1} n j e represents the essential constraints, with n j e \u2264 n being the number of such constraints. The polytopes P j, characterized by these vectors, partition the environment into a hyperplane arrangement.",

This preference can shape decision-making processes and outcomes, reflecting underlying values and priorities. Understanding path preference is crucial for effective communication and negotiation, as it helps in aligning strategies with the perspectives and inclinations of others.",
                        "This section defines a preference \u03b8 in a graphical environment represented by a hyperplane arrangement, where a path preference corresponds to preferred transitions between polytopes. The environment is modeled as an undirected graph G = (V, E), with vertices as obstacle-free polytopes and edges connecting adjacent polytopes. A path preference is defined as the set of preferred transitions across all nodes, with the number of Bayesian updates initially estimated as m \u03b8 \u00d7 m g . By assuming conditional independence of observations and preferences given the robot's location, goal, and current vertex preference, the number of cost computations is reduced to |N (v)| \u00d7 m g .",
                        "The introduction of an assumption removes the direct relationship between the number of polytopes and the complexity of Bayesian updates. While components of \u03b8 are not mutually independent, assuming a dependent relationship between preferences for adjacent edges can improve the model without significantly increasing inference complexity. The encoding ensures that paths from different homotopy classes traverse different sequences of polytopes, which can be proven by contradiction. If two continuous trajectories with the same start and end points traverse the same regions in the same order, they can be smoothly transformed into each other without intersecting obstacles, thus belonging to the same homotopy class."

The robot operates within a deterministic transition model, choosing adjacent or diagonal grid locations. It is given a time limit (T max) to reach the goal, and the human's actions aim to minimize a cost function that considers the shortest path to the goal, subject to preference constraints. The robot's reward model includes goal-specific and preference-related components.

Baseline comparisons are mentioned but not detailed.",

The arbitration is based on the entropy of the intention distribution, with a confidence threshold of 1.6 to decide between the human's input (U) and the robot's prediction (P).",

Success rates are measured across various time delays (\u2206 T) between human inputs, ranging from constant guidance (\u2206 T = 1) to a single observation (\u2206 T \u2265 T max). The compliant policy shows the highest success rates when human inputs are frequent but declines as \u2206 T increases, compared to autonomous baselines. Incorporating path preferences consistently improves performance over a goal-only baseline, especially when blending human input with the robot's policy. In challenging instances where human directions do not align with the shortest path, accounting for path preferences helps the robot maintain a more balanced belief entropy, preventing overconfidence and enabling successful goal attainment. Computation times for solving the POMDP and updating beliefs are also provided.",

The belief update time does not increase with problem complexity, and more obstacles reduce the A* search tree size. Preference policies were hardcoded and problem instances were randomly sampled to minimize bias. The main limitation is the polytope size, which can lead to misinterpretation of human preferences. Future work includes creating benchmarks for preference sampling and improving hyperplane arrangement to better align with environmental topology.",

Experiments in unknown-goal navigation scenarios with sparse human interventions show the method's effectiveness and suitability for online applications.

In both of these methods, the\nnormalized least mean square (NLMS) algorithm is engaged\n\\cite{Haykin96}. The $m^{\\rm th}$ element of the weight vector in\neach stage is the true transmitted binary value of the $m^{\\rm th}$\nuser divided by its hard estimate value from the previous stage. The\nmagnitude of all weight elements in all stages are equal to unity.\nUnlike the LMS-PPIC, the PLMS-PPIC method tries to keep this\nproperty in each iteration by using a set of NLMS algorithms with\ndifferent step-sizes instead of one NLMS algorithm used in LMS-PPIC.\nIn each iteration, the parameter estimate of the NLMS algorithm is\nchosen whose element magnitudes of cancelation weight estimate have\nthe best match with unity. In PLMS-PPIC implementation it is assumed\nthat the receiver knows the phases of all user channels. However in\npractice, these phases are not known and should be estimated. In\nthis paper we improve the PLMS-PPIC procedure \\cite{cohpaper} in\nsuch a way that when there is only a partial information of the\nchannel phases, this modified version simultaneously estimates the\nphases and the cancelation weights. The partial information is the\nquarter of each channel phase in $(0,2\\pi)$.",

                    "The PLMS-PPIC method is a multiuser detector for CDMA receivers aimed at reducing multiple access interference (MAI) by employing a set of Normalized Least Mean Square (NLMS) algorithms with varying step-sizes. Unlike the LMS-PPIC method, PLMS-PPIC ensures that the weight elements remain equal to unity during each iteration. This method has been improved to estimate both channel phases and cancellation weights when only partial phase information is available, specifically the quarter of each channel phase in the interval \\((0, 2\\pi)\\).\n\nIn a synchronous base-band CDMA transmission system with \\(M\\) users, each user transmits symbols using a unique code, and the received signal includes contributions from all users, channel phases, and additive white Gaussian noise. The multistage parallel interference cancellation method iteratively estimates and subtracts MAI from the received signal, updating bit estimates at each stage. The modified PLMS-PIC method involves a multi-stage process for estimating transmitted bits, with simultaneous estimation of cancellation weights and channel phases.\n\nThe parameter estimation process involves selecting the optimal weight estimate by minimizing the sum of absolute deviations from unity, using a set of candidate estimates generated with different step-sizes. The final estimate at time \\(N\\) is considered the true parameter for the stage. Additionally, the method estimates channel phases by dividing the interval \\((0, 2\\pi)\\) into four parts and using the weight estimate to calculate the phase angle.\n\nThe text also discusses a method for estimating channel phases, particularly focusing on the phase \\(\\phi_m\\) using a set \\(P^s\\) that includes three possible phase values derived from \\(\\angle{w^s_m(N)}\\). The method involves determining the correct phase estimate by checking which of these values falls within the same quarter as \\(\\phi_m\\). If none of the values in \\(P^s\\) match the expected region of \\(\\phi_m\\), it indicates a divergence in the estimation process. When \\(\\phi_m\\) is not within the expected range, the method uses the expected value as the optimal choice for phase estimation.\n\nSimulation examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, comparing it with conventional and modified LMS-PPIC methods across various channel conditions, including balanced, unbalanced, and time-varying channels. The performance of these methods is evaluated under different Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR) and channel conditions, with a focus on Bit Error Rate (BER) and average channel phase estimates.

                "There are plenty of other massive problems with germ theory such as why did things like SARS and bird flu magically disappear? Why do we have the symptoms that we do? Is our body controlling the symptoms to help fight the germs and if so, why would suppressing the symptoms with antibiotics or Tamiflu be considered a good idea? If the virus is causing the symptoms then why would it cause these kinds of things?",
                "You asked specifically about the symptoms of the Americans on Dr. Reed's team who got yellow fever in Cuba in 1900. I'll give the passage from The American Plague (162-5), which describes the course of Jesse Lazear's illness. \"In his logbook, Lazear wrote an unusual entry on September 13. In all cases before those, page after page of records, Lazear had used the soldier's name and simply the date he was bitten, with no other attention to the mosquito. A one-line entry with a name and a date. On that day, however, in his elegant hand, Lazear did not write the soldier's name, but instead wrote 'Guinea Pig No. 1.' He went on to write that this guinea pig had been bitten by a mosquito that developed from an egg laid by a mosquito that developed from an egg laid by a mosquito that fed on a number of yellow fever cases: Suarez, Hern\u00e1ndez, De Long, Fer\u00e1ndez. It was a precise, detailed history that proved beyond doubt that the mosquito was loaded with the virus when it bit a healthy soldier...(If he had entered his name, then his death would have been considered medical suicide by the insurance company, and his wife and two children would not have gotten any payment.) For the next few days, Lazear's life continued much as it had over the last few months in Cuba. He fed and cared for the mosquitoes in the lab. ..Then he began to lose his appetite. He skipped a few meals in the mess hall. He didn't mention it to anyone, nor did he ask to see one of the yellow fever doctors; instead, he worked hard in the lab trying to ignore the oncoming headache.",
                "The outcome of disease always depends both on the virulence of the pathogen and the health of the individual immune system. Vaccines are usually effective in giving immunity to the targeted diseases. They also have many dangers which everyone should be aware of, and vaccines should be avoided whenever possible. But in the case of the most dangerous diseases, everyone should learn about them and think about what he wants to do to protect himself and his children from them, considering all the factors involved. And no one can have 100% certainty that he has made the right decision, but that's life. But if you live in the Congo and many people around you are currently dying of yellow fever, then that means that you yourself are at risk of being bitten by a loaded mosquito and getting, often dying, of yellow fever. The yellow fever vaccine is very effective at preventing yellow fever. From there, each person must make a choice.\nAt the end of this stage there is a remission of two or three days. About 80% of those with clinical disease recover at this point, with permanent immunity. The other 20% enter the toxic stage, with a return of the fever, black vomit (coffee-ground emesis), diarrhea, a slowing of the pulse (Faget's sign), jaundice, yellow eyes, yellow skin, and failure of the kidneys, liver, and heart. The patient gets a strange hiccup (like with Ebola, a related disease), falls into a coma, and dies. About half of those patients who enter the toxic stage dies, even now, even with the best of hospital care. The Faget's sign can also occur at the end of the first stage.",
                "As is obvious, there are many problems with vaccines. But, that being said, most of them usually work for a period of time to prevent the targeted diseases. The basic science behind vaccines is correct. Why do you think that within a few years (not many) of the introduction of the vaccines for them, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, Hib disease, and chickenpox (and others) almost entirely disappeared? In the case of the routine childhood diseases, this was a bad thing, but it is a true thing.\nVaccines usually don't cause any obvious reactions. While they usually prevent the diseases, and that's why people continue to get them. With the increasing vaccination schedule, more and more are severely and permanently damaged, and it is immoral to mandate any vaccine for anyone for this reason. But it would also be immoral to prohibit vaccines for those who want them enough to take the risk.\nYour article said as though it had any probative value that 90% of those who get pertussis had been vaxxed. The old DPT vaccine was MUCH more effective at preventing pertussis, but it was so dangerous (again, not to most, but to many), that developed countries replaced it with the acellular version, DTaP. From the beginning about twenty years ago, it was clear that it was not very effective and that huge numbers of vaxxed people got pertussis anyway, including my daughter who got pertussis at eight month old after having gotten three DTaPs. The pertussis vaccine continues to be very dangerous, and I do not recommend that anyone get it. It used to be a killer disease, but evolved to become much milder, to the extent that the disease is very rarely dangerous (usually only to newborns under three months old), while the vaccine is very dangerous. And they're trying to see how they can go back to the old DPT. This does not show that vaccine science has collapsed, but rather that the vaccine they developed to replace the DPT turned out to be much less effective than they first thought, while continuing to be much more dangerous than they first thought.",
                "Hans, you are right that we are looking at one of the biggest crimes in all history. When I read the story of that poor girl who was so healthy and is now confined to a wheelchair after getting her third Gardasil shot I could not believe that Merck could produce such a toxic vaccine and give it out to girls like it was something they absolutely had to have only to be mislead and made into cripples. Merck should be prosecuted for the damage they have done to so many girls who got the Gardasil vaccine and were physically debilitated for life. There is a place for the people who perpetrated this crime on young girls and women and it is called hell. They have destroyed people's lives and gotten away with it. My heart goes out to those who have suffered this damage for no damn good reason except to help make huge profits for Merck!\nHere is the reason that the germ theory is nonsense.\n1) Everyday we are bombarded with billions of germs. Presumably at least some of them are of the kind that germ theorists believe are dangerous (otherwise we would have to conclude that none of them are dangerous). So how do we survive?\n2) Let's just say that we ignore 1 and imagine that, by way of magic, none of the billions of viruses we get bombarded with are pathogenic but all those that are are tucked away somewhere. Ok. But presumably they reside in sick people right? So where are there lots of sick people? Doctor offices and hospitals! So everybody must be dying the moment they enter these places right?\n3) I love this one because I have never seen anybody else ever raise it. Under the germ theory there are no negative feedbacks. This makes a stable biological system by definition impossible. The immune system is *not* a negative feedback it is the opposite. It actually reinforces our math problem because the immune system will weaken as the number of pathogens increase.\nThere is no way of resolving this problem without a discontinuity. A Deus ex Machina as The Almighty Pill so beautifully put it. So the germ theory is quite literally, mathematically impossible.\nThere is as much chance of it being true as 2+2 = 5.",
                "A special tribute to Del Bigtree (pictured) and his team at ICAN for his stunning 88 page letter to the HHS regarding vaccine safety. As Del reported - in the latest edition of Highwire - the letter, in response to an earlier reply from the then acting Director National Vaccine Program Office, Melinda Wharton, took virtually a year to compile, and is a meticulous piece of research. Most sensationally they researched the HHS claim through US government archives that at least some pediatric vaccines had been trialed against genuine placebo, and came to a negative conclusion. Not only that, they established that none of the vaccines those vaccines had been trialed against had ever been trialed against genuine placebo either. At the end of the line the toxic products were only being compared with other toxic products, rather than against saline.\nLeave aside the sceptics, for any believer in the vaccine program as a necessary intervention in public health, this should be a devastating finding. Fundamentally, the research into the safety of any of the products before marketing was simply not there. The manufacturers apparently had no faith that their proto-products could withstand this scrutiny, and for the rest they just did not care: under the alleged imperative of protecting the population it seems anything went. So even before all the sham monitoring procedures and reviews which Del and his team dismantle in forensic detail we are left with the proposition that none of the present products being given to US children \u2013 and frequently other children across most of the developed world \u2013 have any meaningful pre-marketing safety data all. If you are believer in the program you have been let down: if you wanted a program with any pretensions to safety - supposing such a thing to be possible - it looks like you would have to start from scratch. The manufacturers did this: the governments, the politicians and the regulators (internationally) let it happen.",

His head pounded and L. decided to write a letter. ..(he wrote to his mother, and referred to his one-year old son Houston and the baby his wife Mabel was about to have: they were staying with his mother in the US). ..That night, L. started to feel chilled as the fever came on. He never went to sleep but worked at his desk all through the night, trying to get all the information about the mosquitoes organized. By morning, he showed all the signs of a severe attack of yellow fever. The camp doctors made the diagnosis, and L. agreed to go to the yellow fever ward. ..L. was carried by litter out of the two-room, white pine board house in which he had lived since he and Mabel first arrived in Cuba. ..(In the yellow fever ward, in a separate one-room building), Lena Warner (the immune nurse who had survived the yellow fever in 1878, when she was nine, and was found in her boarded-up house by a former slave who first thought she was dead, and carried her to safety) nursed J.L., recording his vitals. (I put up a link to his case record and vital signs last week. The surgeon general required that this record be made for every yellow fever patient.)... (On September 25,) Lena Warner braced L's arms with all of her weight, shouting for help. Still he bolted from the bed, darting around the small frame-wood room as wildly as a trapped insect beating against glass. Two soldiers ran into the ward, pinning L to his bed, tying restraints around his wrists and elbows. ..Warner sponged his body with iced whiskey and water. She recorded his temperature, which had held at 104 degrees for days, on the chart beside his bed. ..(Warner watched him sleep.) But the quiet did not last. L's body began to lurch, and black vomit rolled from his mouth; through the bar hanging above his hospital cot. He writhed in the bed, and his skin grew deep yellow. His 104 temperature slowly fell, leveling out 99 degrees, and JL died at 8:45 p.m. at the age of thirty-four.\"",

A older woman in Mexico City who is like my mother to me had a pacemaker inserted about two months ago to aid her failing heart, and it has restored her to optimism and energy, when she was despondent, weak, and close to death. I took my daughter to the dentist yesterday, who said she has three wisdom teeth coming in and that she said that the lower right one was sore. So, although I am cautious about X-rays, I made an appointment for a panoramic X-ray in a month to assess the wisdom teeth, and, if it seems appropriate, I'll take her to an oral surgeon to have one or more extracted under IV sedation, in his office, if possible (the dentist thought that it would be). And I am confident that there will be no serious problems, but this is thanks to technology and training in modern medicine that haven't been available for that long.\nI think that everyone should inform himself on all medical procedures before agreeing to anything, but I also think that he should have access to any medical procedure which is reasonable (and opinions can differ as to that).\nOne problem is that you have not said how you think people should protect themselves against tetanus, bacterial meningitis, and yellow fever in the relevant cases, for example. These are diseases which healthy, well-nourished people used to die from very readily.\nIf most people stopped vaxxing and the mortality from these diseases rose to something like pre-vaccine levels, do you think they should just accept dying from them?\nI put that in a separate paragraph because it is the crucial issue.\nbalinaheuchter Air Traffic Control You Tube - Colin Campbell example of - How to \"Fudge a Nudge\" -\"Deal\" or \"No Deal\" \"Not in a month of Sundays\" \"No exceptions/no compromise?\" -make a trade off -do an exception- everyone get's a good deal /good outcome!",

The pamphlet airily dismisses concerns that vaccines have side effects or that you could possibly have too many. It is pure public relations, and if the RSPH claims to be \"independent\" it also admits that the publication was paid for by Merck, a detail which was reported by British Medical Journal and the Guardian, but not true to form by the BBC.

                "And you went no way to explaining my arguments against germ theory. If we are attacked by billions of viruses every day then if even a tiny fraction of them are pathogenic then we couldn't possibly survive. And even if we could, we would already be immune rendering every vaccine pointless. Once we had survived our first few days on earth, then we could never get sick again.\nIf that's wrong then we must conclude that precisely 0% of germs are pathogenic.\nPlus your comment about the immune system completely misunderstood my point. The immune system does not allow us to overcome our math problem. In fact, it makes it worse.\nYou did provide one solitary example of a patient with what are presumably yellow fever symptoms but you didn't say whether they had been given any toxic medical treatments.\nAnd like I said before, the whole \"incubation period\" is more than a little suspicious. Clearly they never found what they thought they would and just rigged the results to tell them what they want to hear.\nLike every other germ theorist/vaccine promoter in history.\nMany kinds of bacteria are constantly evolving and changing, like flu viruses. Others are more stable over time, like the yellow fever virus. Those that change develop new ways of infiltrating the cells of the organism being attacked (from our point of view, from its unconscious point of view, it's just carrying out its need to replicate, which it can only do inside the cells of its host). The changes which allow it to better infiltrate are more successful and result in more viruses with those traits.\nOur immune system is designed to detect and destroy potentially dangerous invading pathogens. Many bacteria are usually harmless and absolutely necessary. The minority are dangerous, and most people's immune systems do a good job of analyzing them and killing them, often with no signs of disease. Others experience a clinical infection, and the immune system usually mounts a successful attack on them."

                "\\section{Introduction}\n\nSpectral line surveys have revealed that high-mass star-forming\nregions are rich reservoirs of molecules from simple diatomic species\nto complex and larger molecules (e.g.,\n\\citealt{schilke1997b,hatchell1998b,comito2005,bisschop2007}).\nHowever, there have been rarely studies undertaken to investigate the\nchemical evolution during massive star formation from the earliest\nevolutionary stages, i.e., from High-Mass Starless Cores (HMSCs) and\nHigh-Mass Cores with embedded low- to intermediate-mass protostars\ndestined to become massive stars, via High-Mass Protostellar Objects\n(HMPOs) to the final stars that are able to produce Ultracompact H{\\sc\n  ii} regions (UCH{\\sc ii}s, see \\citealt{beuther2006b} for a recent\ndescription of the evolutionary sequence). The first two evolutionary\nstages are found within so-called Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs).  While\nfor low-mass stars the chemical evolution from early molecular\nfreeze-out to more evolved protostellar cores is well studied (e.g.,\n\\citealt{bergin1997,dutrey1997,pavlyuchenkov2006,joergensen2007}),\nit is far from clear whether similar evolutionary patterns are present\nduring massive star formation.",
                "To understand the observations, we conducted a simple chemical\nmodeling of massive star-forming regions. A 1D cloud model with a mass\nof 1200\\,M$_\\sun$, an outer radius of 0.36\\,pc and a power-law density\nprofile ($\\rho\\propto r^p$ with $p=-1.5$) is the initially assumed\nconfiguration. Three cases are studied: (1) a cold isothermal cloud\nwith $T=10$\\,K, (2) $T=50$\\,K, and (3) a warm model with a temperature\nprofile $T\\propto r^q$ with $q=-0.4$ and a temperature at the outer\nradius of 44\\,K. The cloud is illuminated by the interstellar UV\nradiation field (IRSF, \\citealt{draine1978}) and by cosmic ray\nparticles (CRP). The ISRF attenuation by single-sized $0.1\\mu$m\nsilicate grains at a given radius is calculated in a plane-parallel\ngeometry following \\citet{vandishoeck1988}. The CRP ionization rate is\nassumed to be $1.3\\times 10^{-17}$~s$^{-1}$ \\citep{spitzer1968}. The\ngas-grain chemical model by \\citet{vasyunin2008} with the desorption\nenergies and surface reactions from \\citet{garrod2006} is used.\nGas-phase reaction rates are taken from RATE\\,06 \\citep{woodall2007},\ninitial abundances, were adopted from the ``low metal'' set of\n\\citet{lee1998}.",

However, data\nand model allow a qualitative comparison of the spatial structures.\nEstimating an exact evolutionary time for IRAS\\,18089-1732 is hardly\npossible, but based on the strong molecular line emission, its high\ncentral gas temperatures and the observed outflow-disk system\n\\citep{beuther2004a,beuther2004b,beuther2005c}, an approximate age of\n$5\\times10^4$\\,yr appears reasonable.  Although dynamical and chemical\ntimes are not necessarily exactly the same, in high-mass star\nformation they should not differ to much: Following the models by\n\\citet{mckee2003} or \\citet{krumholz2006b}, the luminosity rises\nstrongly right from the onset of collapse which can be considered as a\nstarting point for the chemical evolution. At the same time disks and\noutflows evolve, which should hence have similar time-scales.  The\ndiameter of the shell-like C$_2$H structure in IRAS\\,18089-1732 is\n$\\sim 5''$ (Fig.\\,\\ref{18089}), or $\\sim$9000\\,AU in radius at the\ngiven distance of 3.6\\,kpc.  This value is well matched by the modeled\nregion with decreased C$_2$H abundance (Fig.\\,\\ref{model}).  Although\nin principle optical depths and/or excitation effects could mimic the\nC$_2$H morphology, we consider this as unlikely because the other\nobserved molecules with many different transitions all peak toward the\ncentral submm continuum emission in IRAS\\,18089-1732\n\\citep{beuther2005c}. Since C$_2$H is the only exception in that rich\ndataset, chemical effects appear the more plausible explanation.",

Long-term goals are the chemical\ncharacterization of the evolutionary sequence in massive star\nformation, the development of chemical clocks, and the identification\nof molecules as astrophysical tools to study the physical processes\nduring different evolutionary stages. Here, we present an initial\nstudy of the reactive radical ethynyl (C$_2$H) combining single-dish\nand interferometer observations with chemical modeling.  Although\nC$_2$H was previously observed in low-mass cores and Photon Dominated\nRegions (e.g., \\citealt{millar1984,jansen1995}), so far it was not\nsystematically investigated in the framework of high-mass star\nformation.\n\n\\section{Observations}\n\\label{obs}",

To recover large-scale\nstructure, we restricted the data to those from the compact SMA\nconfiguration (\\S\\ref{obs}).

In\ncontrast to almost all other molecular lines that peak along with the\ndust continuum \\citep{beuther2005c}, the C$_2$H emission surrounds the\ncontinuum peak in a shell-like fashion.\n\n\\section{Discussion and Conclusions}",

For this project, we\nre-worked on these data only using the compact configuration.

While we see several CH$_3$OH lines as well as\nSO$_2$ and H$_2$CS toward some of the HMPOs and UCH{\\sc ii}s but not\ntoward the IRDCs, the surprising result of this comparison is the\npresence of the C$_2$H lines around 349.4\\,GHz toward all source types\nfrom young IRDCs via the HMPOs to evolved UCH{\\sc ii}s.  Table\n\\ref{sample} lists the peak brightness temperatures, the integrated\nintensities and the FWHM line-widths of the C$_2$H line blend at\n349.399\\,GHz. The separation of the two lines of 1.375\\,MHz already\ncorresponds to a line-width of 1.2\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$.

While IRDCs are on average colder than\nmore evolved sources, and have lower brightness temperatures, the\nnon-detections are more probable due to the relatively low sensitivity\nof the short observations (\\S\\ref{obs}). Hence, the data indicate\nthat the C$_2$H lines are detected independent of the evolutionary\nstage of the sources in contrast to the situation with other\nmolecules.  When comparing the line-widths between the different\nsub-groups, one finds only a marginal difference between the IRDCs and\nthe HMPOs (the average $\\Delta v$ of the two groups are 2.8 and\n3.1\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$).

An alternative way to\nproduce C$_2$H$_2^+$ is the dissociative recombination of CH$_5^+$\ninto CH$_3$ followed by reactions with C$^+$.  Finally, C$_2$H$_2^+$\nand C$_2$H$_3^+$ dissociatively recombine into CH, C$_2$H, and\nC$_2$H$_2$. The major removal for C$_2$H is either the direct\nneutral-neutral reaction with O that forms CO, or the same reaction\nbut with heavier carbon chain ions that are formed from C$_2$H by\nsubsequent insertion of carbon. At later times, depletion and\ngas-phase reactions with more complex species may enter into this\ncycle.

                "The study investigates the chemical evolution of high-mass star-forming regions, focusing on the role of ethynyl (C\u2082H) in different stages of massive star formation, from High-Mass Starless Cores and High-Mass Cores with embedded protostars to Ultracompact HII (UCHII) regions. The research combines observational data from single-dish line surveys and interferometers, such as the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) and the Submillimeter Array (SMA), with theoretical modeling to develop a comprehensive understanding of the chemical processes involved.\n\nKey findings include the detection of C\u2082H lines across all evolutionary stages, with notable differences in line-widths and spatial distributions. C\u2082H emission forms a shell-like structure around the continuum peak in evolved stages, suggesting a distinct spatial distribution compared to other molecules. This distinct behavior is attributed to the chemical evolution of C\u2082H, which is influenced by the relative removal rates of carbon and oxygen atoms or ions, forming molecules like CO and H\u2082O.\n\nTheoretical modeling using a 1D cloud model with varying temperature profiles (10 K, 50 K, and a gradient profile) reveals that C\u2082H abundance decreases over time in warmer models due to efficient transformation into CO and other molecules. In contrast, in colder models, C\u2082H remains stable due to gas-grain interactions and surface reactions. The study also qualitatively compares the model with observations of IRAS 18089-1732, a high-mass star-forming region, finding that C\u2082H emission is anti-correlated with dust continuum emission.\n\nOverall, the research aims to characterize the chemical evolution in massive star formation, develop chemical clocks, and identify molecules like C\u2082H as tools to study physical processes during different evolutionary stages. C\u2082H is particularly useful for tracing the earliest stages of star formation and can provide insights into gas kinematics and temperature."

                    "The document discusses the dynamics of electron density in the context of drift-fluid models, focusing on the continuity equation and the assumption of quasineutrality. It explores the evolution of density through a vorticity equation, which is utilized in numerical simulations. The equations under consideration have several conserved quantities, including relative particle number, entropy, potential energy, and kinetic energy. These conserved quantities are crucial for understanding the behavior of plasma in various magnetic field configurations, such as homogeneous and inhomogeneous magnetic fields in Cartesian coordinates and tokamaks, respectively.\n\nThe text also examines the constraints imposed by these invariants on the velocity and acceleration of plasma blobs, defining the center of mass (COM) and its velocity. It derives inequalities relating the COM velocity to the initial entropy and energy of the system, supported by numerical results. The density field is initialized with a Gaussian blob, leading to specific initial conditions for mass, energy, growth rate, and entropy.\n\nThe acceleration of plasma flows, both incompressible and compressible, is estimated using a linear acceleration model. The model predicts that the acceleration is proportional to the relative change in density for small perturbations and approaches the gravitational acceleration for large perturbations. The maximum center of mass (COM) velocity for compressible flows is constrained by an inequality that scales with the electron temperature, structure function, and ion mass, leading to a restriction on the COM velocity relative to the sound speed. This analysis confirms previous predictions and reproduces known limits in the field.",
                    "The study presents a phenomenological model to describe the dynamics of blobs and depletions in plasma systems, inspired by the behavior of an infinitely long plasma column immersed in an ambient plasma. The model simplifies the dynamics to a two-dimensional ball experiencing buoyancy, linear, and nonlinear friction forces. Key dynamics, including acceleration and specific scaling relations for both incompressible and compressible flows, are reproduced by the model. The buoyancy term accounts for the gravitational mass of the ball and the mass of the displaced ambient plasma, with the ball potentially representing a depletion that rises due to negative buoyancy.\n\nThe model introduces an inertial mass \\( M_{\\text{i}} \\) that differs from the gravitational mass \\( M_{\\text{g}} \\) to recover initial acceleration, with parameters interpreted as geometrical factors reflecting deviations from an idealized \"top hat\" solution. The Boussinesq approximation, which neglects inertia, results in \\( M_{\\text{i}} = \\pi\\ell^2n_0 \\). Linear friction is represented by a coefficient \\( c_1(\\ell) \\) dependent on the ball's size, while nonlinear friction is considered by setting \\( c_2 = 0 \\). This yields a maximum velocity \\( c_1V^* = \\pi \\ell^2 n g \\mathcal Q \\triangle n / 2 \\), with the linear friction coefficient \\( c_1 \\) given by \\( \\pi \\ell^2 n_0 g / C_\\mathrm{s} \\), dependent on gravity and the ball's size.\n\nThe study derives the maximum absolute velocity \\( \\max |V| \\) considering both linear and nonlinear friction, leading to a concise expression capturing both linear and square root scaling. The maximum time \\( t_{\\max V} \\) is proportional to the ratio of the maximum velocity \\( V \\) to a constant \\( A_0 \\), with the inverse \\( \\gamma \\) representing the global interchange growth rate.\n\nSimulations are conducted using the open-source library FELTOR, employing discontinuous Galerkin methods with high-resolution grids to minimize finite-size effects. The simulations verify the model's accuracy and consistency with gyrofluid model simulations. Initial perturbations in particle density range from \\( 10^{-3} \\) to 20 for blobs and \\( -10^0 \\) to \\( -10^{-3} \\) for depletions. Compressible flows are studied for \\( \\ell/R_0 = 10^{-2} \\) and \\( 10^{-3} \\), while incompressible flows are normalized to eliminate blob radius dependence.\n\nThe results show that incompressible blobs closely follow a square root scaling, except at very large amplitudes where velocities are slightly lower. Compressible blobs initially exhibit a linear scaling at small amplitudes, transitioning to a square root scaling at higher amplitudes, consistent with theoretical predictions. The transition occurs at different amplitude thresholds depending on the blob size. For plasma depletions, velocities match those of blobs for relative amplitude values below 0.5, and follow a square root scaling for amplitudes above 0.5.

Institutions: University of California, Irvine (UCI).In this video, we demonstrate the preparation of primary neuronal cultures from the brains of late stage Drosophila pupae. The procedure begins with the removal of brains from animals at 70-78 hrs after puparium formation. The isolated brains are shown after brief incubation in papain followed by several washes in serum-free growth medium. The process of mechanical dissociation of each brain in a 5 ul drop of media on a coverslip is illustrated. The axons and dendrites of the post-mitotic neurons are sheered off near the soma during dissociation but the neurons begin to regenerate processes within a few hours of plating. Images show live cultures at 2 days. Neurons continue to elaborate processes during the first week in culture. Specific neuronal populations can be identified in culture using GAL4 lines to drive tissue specific expression of fluorescent markers such as GFP or RFP. Whole cell recordings have demonstrated the cultured neurons form functional, spontaneously active cholinergic and GABAergic synapses. A short video segment illustrates calcium dynamics in the cultured neurons using Fura-2 as a calcium indicator dye to monitor spontaneous calcium transients and nicotine evoked calcium responses in a dish of cultured neurons.

Starting from sample fixation, this protocol details how to quantify synapse number both in dissociated neuronal culture and in brain sections using immunocytochemistry. Using compartment-specific antibodies, we label presynaptic terminals as well as sites of postsynaptic specialization. We define synapses as points of colocalization between the signals generated by these markers.

Reduced number and aberrant architecture of dendritic spines are common features of DS neuropathology. However, the mechanisms involved in DS spine alterations are not known. In addition to a relevant role in synapse formation and maintenance, astrocytes can regulate spine dynamics by releasing soluble factors or by physical contact with neurons.

Unlike most established human glioblastoma cell line xenografts, injection of transformed GEM-derived cortical astrocytes into the brains of immune-competent littermates produced astrocytomas, including the most aggressive subtype, glioblastoma, that recapitulated the histopathological hallmarks of human astrocytomas, including diffuse invasion of normal brain parenchyma. Bioluminescence imaging of orthotopic allografts from transformed astrocytes engineered to express luciferase was utilized to monitor in vivo tumor growth over time.

Madison, Johanna M. Montgomery. Institutions: University of Auckland, Stanford University.Pair recordings involve simultaneous whole cell patch clamp recordings from two synaptically connected neurons, enabling not only direct electrophysiological characterization of the synaptic connections between individual neurons, but also pharmacological manipulation of either the presynaptic or the postsynaptic neuron. When carried out in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, the probability that two neurons are synaptically connected is significantly increased. This preparation readily enables identification of cell types, and the neurons maintain their morphology and properties of synaptic function similar to that in native brain tissue. A major advantage of paired whole cell recordings is the highly precise information it can provide on the properties of synaptic transmission and plasticity that are not possible with other more crude techniques utilizing extracellular axonal stimulation. Paired whole cell recordings are often perceived as too challenging to perform. While there are challenging aspects to this technique, paired recordings can be performed by anyone trained in whole cell",

Institutions: Tufts University, Tufts Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences.Proper neuron to glia interaction is critical to physiological function of the central nervous system (CNS). This bidirectional communication is sophisticatedly mediated by specific signaling pathways between neuron and glia1,2 . Identification and characterization of these signaling pathways is essential to the understanding of how neuron to glia interaction shapes CNS physiology. Previously, neuron and glia mixed cultures have been widely utilized for testing and characterizing signaling pathways between neuron and glia. What we have learned from these preparations and other in vivo tools, however, has suggested that mutual signaling between neuron and glia often occurred in specific compartments within neurons (i.e., axon, dendrite, or soma)3. This makes it important to develop a new culture system that allows separation of neuronal compartments and specifically examines the interaction between glia and neuronal axons/dendrites. In addition, the conventional mixed culture system is not capable of differentiating the soluble factors and direct membrane contact signals between neuron and glia. Furthermore, the large quantity of neurons and glial cells in the conventional co-culture system lacks the resolution necessary to observe the interaction between a single axon and a glial cell.",

Thereafter, the tissue homogenate was centrifuged in bovine serum albumin to separate vessel fragments from nervous tissue. The vessel fragments underwent a second enzymatic digestion to free endothelial cells from their extracellular matrix. The remaining contaminating cells such as pericytes were further eliminated by plating the microvessel fragments in puromycin-containing medium. They were then passaged onto filters for co-culture with astrocytes grown on the bottom of the wells. RBEC expressed high levels of tight junction (TJ) proteins such as occludin, claudin-5 and ZO-1 with a typical localization at the cell borders. The transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) of brain endothelial monolayers, indicating the tightness of TJs reached 300 ohm\u00b7cm2 on average. The endothelial permeability coefficients (Pe) for lucifer yellow (LY) was highly reproducible with an average of 0.26 \u00b1 0.11 x 10-3 cm/min. Brain endothelial cells organized in monolayers expressed the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp), showed a polarized transport of rhodamine 123, a ligand for P-gp, and showed specific transport of transferrin-Cy3 and DiILDL across the endothelial cell monolayer.

In vitro astrocyte cell culture systems can be used to study the biological functions of these glial cells in detail. This video protocol shows how to obtain pure astrocytes by isolation and culture of mixed cortical cells of mouse pups. The method is based on the absence of viable neurons and the separation of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia, the three main glial cell populations of the central nervous system, in culture. Representative images during the first days of culture demonstrate the presence of a mixed cell population and indicate the timepoint, when astrocytes become confluent and should be separated from microglia and oligodendrocytes. Moreover, we demonstrate purity and astrocytic morphology of cultured astrocytes using immunocytochemical stainings for well established and newly described astrocyte markers. This culture system can be easily used to obtain pure mouse astrocytes and astrocyte-conditioned medium for studying various aspects of astrocyte biology.Neuroscience, Issue 71, Neurobiology, Cellular Biology, Medicine, Molecular Biology, Anatomy, Physiology, brain, mouse, astrocyte culture, astrocyte, fibroblast, fibrinogen, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, neuronal regeneration, cell culture, animal model50079Play ButtonImaging Dendritic Spines of Rat Primary Hippocampal Neurons using Structured Illumination MicroscopyAuthors: Marijn Schouten, Giulia M.

                "However following transplantation, Schwann cells do not migrate from the site of implant and do not intermingle with the host astrocytes 6,7. This results in formation of a sharp boundary between the Schwann cells and astrocytes, creating an obstacle for growing axons trying to exit the graft back into the host tissue proximally and distally. Astrocytes in contact with Schwann cells also undergo hypertrophy and up-regulate the inhibitory molecules 8-13.\nIn vitro assays have been used to model Schwann cell-astrocyte interactions and have been important in understanding the mechanism underlying the cellular behaviour.\nThese in vitro assays include boundary assay, where a co-culture is made using two different cells with each cell type occupying different territories with only a small gap separating the two cell fronts. As the cells divide and migrate, the two cellular fronts get closer to each other and finally collide. This allows the behaviour of the two cellular populations to be analyzed at the boundary. Another variation of the same technique is to mix the two cellular populations in culture and over time the two cell types segregate with Schwann cells clumped together as islands in between astrocytes together creating multiple Schwann-astrocyte boundaries.\nThe second assay used in studying the interaction of two cell types is the migration assay where cellular movement can be tracked on the surface of the other cell type monolayer 14,15. This assay is commonly known as inverted coverslip assay. Schwann cells are cultured on small glass fragments and they are inverted face down onto the surface of astrocyte monolayers and migration is assessed from the edge of coverslip.\nBoth assays have been instrumental in studying the underlying mechanisms involved in the cellular exclusion and boundary formation. Some of the molecules identified using these techniques include N-Cadherins 15, Chondroitin Sulphate proteoglycans(CSPGs) 16,17, FGF/Heparin 18, Eph/Ephrins19.",
                "Dendritic spines are the sites of the majority of excitatory connections within the brain, and form the post-synaptic compartment of synapses. These structures are rich in actin and have been shown to be highly dynamic. In response to classical Hebbian plasticity as well as neuromodulatory signals, dendritic spines can change shape and number, which is thought to be critical for the refinement of neural circuits and the processing and storage of information within the brain. Within dendritic spines, a complex network of proteins link extracellular signals with the actin cyctoskeleton allowing for control of dendritic spine morphology and number. Neuropathological studies have demonstrated that a number of disease states, ranging from schizophrenia to autism spectrum disorders, display abnormal dendritic spine morphology or numbers. Moreover, recent genetic studies have identified mutations in numerous genes that encode synaptic proteins, leading to suggestions that these proteins may contribute to aberrant spine plasticity that, in part, underlie the pathophysiology of these disorders. In order to study the potential role of these proteins in controlling dendritic spine morphologies/number, the use of cultured cortical neurons offers several advantages. Firstly, this system allows for high-resolution imaging of dendritic spines in fixed cells as well as time-lapse imaging of live cells. Secondly, this in vitro system allows for easy manipulation of protein function by expression of mutant proteins, knockdown by shRNA constructs, or pharmacological treatments. These techniques allow researchers to begin to dissect the role of disease-associated proteins and to predict how mutations of these proteins may function in vivo.",

Niederriter, Erica E. Davis, Christelle Golzio, Edwin C. Oh, I-Chun Tsai, Nicholas Katsanis. Institutions: Duke University Medical Center, Duke University, Duke University Medical Center.Here, we present methods for the development of assays to query potentially clinically significant nonsynonymous changes using in vivo complementation in zebrafish. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are a useful animal system due to their experimental tractability; embryos are transparent to enable facile viewing, undergo rapid development ex vivo, and can be genetically manipulated.1 These aspects have allowed for significant advances in the analysis of embryogenesis, molecular processes, and morphogenetic signaling. Taken together, the advantages of this vertebrate model make zebrafish highly amenable to modeling the developmental defects in pediatric disease, and in some cases, adult-onset disorders. Because the zebrafish genome is highly conserved with that of humans (~70% orthologous), it is possible to recapitulate human disease states in zebrafish. This is accomplished either through the injection of mutant human mRNA to induce dominant negative or gain of function alleles, or utilization of morpholino (MO) antisense oligonucleotides to suppress genes to mimic loss of function variants. Through complementation of MO-induced phenotypes with capped human mRNA, our approach enables the interpretation of the deleterious effect of mutations on human protein sequence based on the ability of mutant mRNA to rescue a measurable, physiologically relevant phenotype. Modeling of the human disease alleles occurs through microinjection of zebrafish embryos with MO and/or human mRNA at the",

However, the ability of astrocytic receptors to exhibit plasticity in response to changes in neuronal activity has received little attention. Here we describe a model system that can be used to globally scale up or down astrocytic group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in acute brain slices. Included are methods on how to prepare parasagittal hippocampal slices, construct chambers suitable for long-term slice incubation, bidirectionally manipulate neuronal action potential frequency, load astrocytes and astrocyte processes with fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, and measure changes in astrocytic Gq GPCR activity by recording spontaneous and evoked astrocyte Ca2+ events using confocal microscopy. In essence, a \u201ccalcium roadmap\u201d is provided for how to measure plasticity of astrocytic Gq GPCRs. Applications of the technique for study of astrocytes are discussed.

                "Several recently developed super resolution techniques have been used to image cellular structures smaller than the 200 nm, including dendritic spines. These techniques are based on classical far-field operations and therefore allow the use of existing sample preparation methods and to image beyond the surface of a specimen. Described here is a working protocol to apply super resolution structured illumination microscopy (SIM) to the imaging of dendritic spines in primary hippocampal neuron cultures. Possible applications of SIM overlap with those of confocal microscopy. However, the two techniques present different applicability. SIM offers higher effective lateral resolution, while confocal microscopy, due to the usage of a physical pinhole, achieves resolution improvement at the expense of removal of out of focus light. In this protocol, primary neurons are cultured on glass coverslips using a standard protocol, transfected with DNA plasmids encoding fluorescent proteins and imaged using SIM. The whole protocol described herein takes approximately 2 weeks, because dendritic spines are imaged after 16-17 days in vitro, when dendritic development is optimal. After completion of the protocol, dendritic spines can be reconstructed in 3D from series of SIM image stacks using specialized software.Neuroscience, Issue 87, Dendritic Spine, Microscopy, Confocal, Fluorescence, Neurosciences, hippocampus, primary neuron, super resolution microscopy, structured illumination microscopy (SIM), neuroscience, dendrite51276Play ButtonSetting-up an In Vitro Model of Rat Blood-brain Barrier (BBB): A Focus on BBB Impermeability and Receptor-mediated TransportAuthors: Yves Molino, Fran\u00e7oise Jab\u00e8s, Emmanuelle Lacassagne, Nicolas Gaudin, Michel Khrestchatisky.

LTP elicited in the CA1 region of acute hippocampal slices has been extensively studied. However the molecular mechanisms underlying the maintenance phase of this phenomenon are still poorly understood. This could be partly due to the various experimental conditions used by different laboratories. Indeed, the maintenance phase of LTP is strongly dependent on external parameters like oxygenation, temperature and humidity. It is also dependent on internal parameters like orientation of the slicing plane and slice viability after dissection.",
                "(GABAARs) present at the plasma membrane of the synapse-receiving, postsynaptic neurons. Activation of these GABA-gated ion channels leads to influx of chloride resulting in postsynaptic potential changes that decrease the probability that these neurons will generate action potentials. During development, diverse types of inhibitory neurons with distinct morphological, electrophysiological and neurochemical characteristics have the ability to recognize their target neurons and form synapses which incorporate specific GABAARs subtypes. This principle of selective innervation of neuronal targets raises the question as to how the appropriate synaptic partners identify each other. To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms, a novel in vitro co-culture model system was established, in which medium spiny GABAergic neurons, a highly homogenous population of neurons isolated from the embryonic striatum, were cultured with stably transfected HEK293 cell lines that express different GABAAR subtypes. Synapses form rapidly, efficiently and selectively in this system, and are easily accessible for quantification. Our results indicate that various GABAAR subtypes differ in their ability to promote synapse formation, suggesting that this reduced in vitro model system can be used to reproduce, at least in part, the in vivo conditions required for the recognition of the appropriate synaptic partners and formation of specific synapses. Here the protocols for culturing the medium spiny neurons and generating HEK293 cells lines expressing GABAARs are first described, followed by detailed instructions on how to combine these two cell types in co-culture and analyze the formation of synaptic contacts.

Therefore, images can be acquired immediately after surgery is performed. The experimental procedure can be performed repetitively over various time intervals ranging from hours to years.

In this microfluidic culture platform, only neuronal processes (especially axons) can enter the glial side through the central channels. In combination with powerful fluorescent protein labeling, this system allows direct examination of signaling pathways between axonal/dendritic and glial interactions, such as axon-mediated transcriptional regulation in glia, glia-mediated receptor trafficking in neuronal terminals, and glia-mediated axon growth. The narrow diameter of the chamber also significantly prohibits the flow of the neuron-enriched medium into the glial chamber, facilitating probing of the direct membrane-protein interaction between axons/dendrites and glial surfaces.Neuroscience, Issue 68, Molecular Biology, Cellular Biology, Biophysics, Microfluidics, Microfluidic culture platform, Compartmented culture, Neuron to glia signaling, neurons, glia, cell culture4448Play ButtonFluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) of Fluorescence Tagged Proteins in Dendritic Spines of Cultured Hippocampal NeuronsAuthors: Chan-Ying Zheng, Ronald S.

                "for cognitive impairments. The hippocampal slice is especially popular for the study of synaptic plasticity mechanisms involved in learning and memory. Changes in the induction of long-term potentiation and depression (LTP and LTD) of synaptic efficacy in hippocampal slices (or lack thereof) are frequently used to describe the neurologic phenotype of cognitively-impaired animals and/or to evaluate the mechanism of action of nootropic compounds. This article outlines the procedures we use for preparing hippocampal slices from rats and transgenic mice for the study of synaptic alterations associated with brain aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD)1-3. Use of aged rats and AD model mice can present a unique set of challenges to researchers accustomed to using younger rats and/or mice in their research. Aged rats have thicker skulls and tougher connective tissue than younger rats and mice, which can delay brain extraction and/or dissection and consequently negate or exaggerate real age-differences in synaptic function and plasticity. Aging and amyloid pathology may also exacerbate hippocampal damage sustained during the dissection procedure, again complicating any inferences drawn from physiologic assessment. Here, we discuss the steps taken during the dissection procedure to minimize these problems. Examples of synaptic responses acquired in \"healthy\" and \"unhealthy\" slices from rats and mice are provided, as well as representative synaptic plasticity experiments. The possible impact of other methodological factors on synaptic function in these animal models (e.g. recording solution components, stimulation parameters) are also discussed.

Haustein, Michael V. Sofroniew, Baljit S. Khakh. Institutions: University of California Los Angeles, University of California Los Angeles.Astrocytes display spontaneous intracellular Ca2+ concentration fluctuations ([Ca2+]i) and in several settings respond to neuronal excitation with enhanced [Ca2+]i signals. It has been proposed that astrocytes in turn regulate neurons and blood vessels through calcium-dependent mechanisms, such as the release of signaling molecules. However, [Ca2+]i imaging in entire astrocytes has only recently become feasible with genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) such as the GCaMP series. The use of GECIs in astrocytes now provides opportunities to study astrocyte [Ca2+]i signals in detail within model microcircuits such as the striatum, which is the largest nucleus of the basal ganglia. In the present report, detailed surgical methods to express GECIs in astrocytes in vivo, and confocal imaging approaches to record [Ca2+]i signals in striatal astrocytes in situ, are described.

Institutions: University of Wuerzburg, Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology, Martinsried, Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich.Visualization of calcium dynamics is important to understand the role of calcium in cell physiology. To examine calcium dynamics, synthetic fluorescent Ca2+ indictors have become popular. Here we demonstrate TED (= targeted-esterase induced dye loading), a method to improve the release of Ca2+ indicator dyes in the ER lumen of different cell types. To date, TED was used in cell lines, glial cells, and neurons in vitro. TED bases on efficient, recombinant targeting of a high carboxylesterase activity to the ER lumen using vector-constructs that express Carboxylesterases (CES). The latest TED vectors contain a core element of CES2 fused to a red fluorescent protein, thus enabling simultaneous two-color imaging.

Gaffney, Joseph J. Bass, Thomas F. Barratt, Nathaniel J. Szewczyk. Institutions: University of Nottingham.Muscle is a dynamic tissue that responds to changes in nutrition, exercise, and disease state. The loss of muscle mass and function with disease and age are significant public health burdens. We currently understand little about the genetic regulation of muscle health with disease or age. The nematode C. elegans is an established model for understanding the genomic regulation of biological processes of interest. This worm\u2019s body wall muscles display a large degree of homology with the muscles of higher metazoan species. Since C. elegans is a transparent organism, the localization of GFP to mitochondria and sarcomeres allows visualization of these structures in vivo. Similarly, feeding animals cationic dyes, which accumulate based on the existence of a mitochondrial membrane potential, allows the assessment of mitochondrial function in vivo. These methods, as well as assessment of muscle protein homeostasis, are combined with assessment of whole animal muscle function, in the form of movement assays, to allow correlation of sub-cellular defects with functional measures of muscle performance. Thus, C. elegans provides a powerful platform with which to assess the impact of mutations, gene knockdown, and/or chemical compounds upon muscle structure and function. Lastly, as GFP, cationic dyes, and movement assays are assessed non-invasively, prospective studies of muscle structure and function can be conducted across the whole life course and this at present cannot be easily investigated in vivo in any other organism.Developmental Biology, Issue 93, Physiology, C."

It prevents substantial muscle shortening and ensures accurate force production and sensitivity to agonists, as these factors depend on the extent of stretch. Stainless steel wires are preferred over tungsten due to oxidation issues with the latter. This method enables the comparison of agonist-induced contractions, providing evidence for normal vascular smooth muscle cell receptor function.",
                        "The article discusses the use of in utero electroporation (IUE) as a technique to study the development of the embryonic nervous system, particularly in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The authors provide a detailed protocol for electroporating these regions in utero and demonstrate its effectiveness in studying dendrites and spines. This method has been widely used to investigate cellular proliferation, differentiation, and neuronal migration in the developing cerebral cortex.",
                        "In utero electroporation (IUE) is a powerful method for studying gene interactions in neuronal development, offering advantages over viral gene transfer methods by allowing the combination of multiple RNAi or transgenes in the same cell population. This technique has contributed to understanding brain function and disease mechanisms and is useful for studying dendrites, spines, and synapse development. Additionally, a microfluidic culture platform (MCP)-based system enables the co-culture of neuronal axons and glia, facilitating the analysis of neuron-to-glia interactions critical for central nervous system function. This system allows for the separation of neuronal compartments and the differentiation of signaling pathways, overcoming limitations of conventional mixed culture systems.",
                        "This study introduces a novel axon and glia co-culture system using a microfluidic culture platform (MCP). Neurons and glial cells are cultured in separate chambers connected by central channels, allowing only neuronal processes (axons) to enter the glial side. This setup enables direct examination of signaling pathways between axonal/dendritic and glial interactions, such as axon-mediated transcriptional regulation in glia and glia-mediated axon growth. The system also facilitates studying direct membrane-protein interactions between axons/dendrites and glial surfaces. Additionally, Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) is used to quantify the mobility of GFP-tagged proteins in dendritic spines of cultured hippocampal neurons, providing insights into protein mobility and turnover rates.",
                        "This video demonstrates the preparation of primary neuronal cultures from the brains of late-stage Drosophila pupae, a process involving the removal of brains at 70-78 hours after puparium formation, followed by incubation in papain and mechanical dissociation. The neurons, which begin to regenerate processes within hours of plating, continue to elaborate processes during the first week in culture. These cultures are useful for studying synaptic formation and function using genetic and pharmacological tools, as they form functional synapses and exhibit calcium dynamics."

In addition, the committee discussed election issues of concern to the Southern California Section.\nWe hope you enjoyed the presidential and division thematic program, \"Sustainability of Energy, Food & Water\" in Chicago. A small, dedicated group of volunteers and staff labored tirelessly to create and coordinate this programming; to them the Committee on Divisional Activities (DAC) offers sincere thanks.\nDAC has committed to transfer the process of choosing and organizing future national meeting themes to a body that represents all divisions. We made substantial progress in Chicago, where division, secretariat, and committee representatives convened to discuss national meeting program concepts. They proposed themes for the 2008 Philadelphia national meeting as well as a framework for a future national programming group.\nDivisions have successfully served their members fortunate enough to attend national meetings. To maximize benefits to division members, DAC encourages divisions to consider extending the reach of the content they deliver at national meetings through Internet-based distribution channels and will support worthy efforts in this direction via Innovative Program Grants.\nThe committee voted in Chicago to propose modifications to the division funding formula that will more greatly reward interdisciplinary programming. The new formula will also be simpler and more transparent to divisions. DAC will present the revised plan to council for action in Boston."

                "We first look at the evolved learning rate \u03b7 p , which determines how fast (if at all) the network's weight vector is updated during the lifetime of the agents. We identify three factors that control the learning rate parameter the EA converges to: the distance between the environments, the noisiness of the reward, and the rate of environmental transition.\nThe first natural factor is the distance d e between the two environments, with a larger distance requiring a higher learning rate, Fig. . This is an expected result since the convergence time to the \"correct\" weights is highly dependent on the initial conditions. If an agent is born at a point very close to optimality, which naturally happens if the environments are similar, the distance it needs to traverse on the fitness landscape is small.\nTherefore it can afford to have a small learning rate, which leads to a more stable convergence and is not affected by noise. A second parameter that impacts the learning rate is the variance of the rewards. The reward an agent receives for the plasticity step contains a noise term \u03be that is drawn from a zero mean Gaussian distribution with standard deviation \u03c3.\nThis parameter controls the unreliability of the agent's sensory system, i.e., higher \u03c3 means that the information the agent gets about the value of the foods it consumes cannot be fully trusted to reflect the actual value of the foods. As \u03c3 increases, the learning rate \u03b7 p decreases, which means that the more unreliable an environment becomes, the less an agent relies on plasticity to update its weights, Fig. .\nIndeed for some combinations of relatively small distance d e and high reward variance \u03c3, the EA converges to a learning rate of \u03b7 p \u2248 0. This means that the agent opts to have no adaptation during its lifetime and remain at the mean of the two environments. It is an optimal solution when the expected loss due to ignoring the environmental transitions is, on average, lower than the loss the plastic network will incur by learning via the (often misleading because of the high \u03c3) environmental cues.",
                "Still, more data would be needed to make any conclusive assertions about the exact effect of these environmental parameters on the emerging plasticity mechanisms. A crucial difference between the static and the moving agents is the function the plasticity has to perform. While in the static agents, the plasticity has to effectively identify the exact value distribution of the environment in order to produce accurate predictions, in the embodied agents, the plasticity has to merely produce a representation of the environment that the motor network can evolve to interpret adequately enough to make decisions about which food to consume.\nTo illustrate the difference, we plot the Pearson correlation coefficient between an agent's weights and the ingredient values of the environment it is moving in (Fig. ). We use the correlation instead of the MSE loss (which we used for the static agents in Fig. ) because the amplitude of the vector varies a lot for different agents and meaningful The evolved parameters of moving agents' plasticity rule for the g(s) = x, identity (a.) and the step function (Eq.\n4) (b.) sensory networks (the environmental parameters here are d e \u2208 [0, 1], \u03c3 = 0 and p tr = 0.001). The step function (binary output) network evolved a more structured plasticity rule (e.g., \u03b8 3 > 0 for all realizations) than the linear network. Moreover, the learned weights for the identity network (c.) have higher variance and correlate significantly less with the environment's ingredient distribution compared to the learned weights for the thresholded network (d.)\nconclusions cannot be drawn from the MSE loss. For many agents, the learned weights are consistently anti-correlated with the actual ingredient values (an example of such an agent is shown in Fig. ). This means that the output of the sensory network will have the opposite sign from the actual food value.\nWhile in the static network, this would lead to very bad predictions and high loss, in the foraging task, these agents perform exactly as well as the ones where the weights and ingredients values are positively correlated, since the motor network can simply learn to move towards food for which it gets a negative instead of a positive sensory input.",
                "This additional step of the output of the plastic network going through the motor network before producing any behavior has a strong effect on the plasticity rules that the embodied agents evolve. Specifically, if we look at the emerging rules the top performing agents have evolved (Fig. ), it becomes clear that, unlike the very well-structured rules of the static agents (Fig. ), there is now virtually no discernible pattern or structure.\nThe difference becomes even clearer if we look at the learned weights (at the end of a simulation) of the best-performing agents (Fig. ). While there is some correlation with the environment's ingredient value distribution, the variance is very large, and they do not seem to converge on the \"correct\" values in any way.\nThis is to some extent expected since, unlike the static agents where the network's output has to be exactly correct, driving the evolution of rules that converge to the precise environmental distribution, in the embodied networks, the bulk of the processing is done by the motor network which can evolve to interpret the scalar value of the sensory network's output in a variety of ways.\nThus, as long as the sensory network's plasticity rule co-evolves with the motor network, any plasticity rule that learns to produce consistent information about the value of encountered food can potentially be selected. To further test this assumption, we introduce a bottleneck of information propagation between the sensory and motor networks by using a step-function nonlinearity on the output of the sensory network (Eq.\n4). Similarly to the decision task of the static network, the output of the sensory network now becomes binary. This effectively reduces the flow of information from the sensory to the motor network, forcing the sensory network to consistently decide whether food should be consumed (with the caveat that the motor network can still interpret the binary sign in either of two ways, either consuming food marked with 1 or the ones marked with 0 by the sensory network).\nThe agents perform equally well in this variation of the task as before (Fig. ), but now, the evolved plasticity rules seem to be more structured (Fig. ). Moreover, the variance of the learned weights in the bestperforming agents is significantly reduced (Fig. ), which indicates that the bottleneck in the sensory network is in-creasing selection pressure for rules that learn the environment's food distribution accurately.",
                "Several studies have demonstrated how, in biological networks, synaptic plasticity heavily interacts with and is driven by network topology . Moreover, it has been recently demonstrated that biological plasticity mechanisms are highly redundant in the sense that any observed neural connectivity or recorded activity can be achieved with a variety of distinct, unrelated learning rules .\nThis observed redundancy of learning rules in biological settings complements our results and suggests that the function of plasticity rules cannot be studied independently of the connectivity and topology of the networks they are acting on. The optimization of functional plasticity in neural networks is a promising research direction both as a means to understand biological learning processes and as a tool for building more autonomous artificial systems.\nOur results suggest that reward-modulated plasticity is highly adaptable to different environments and can be incorporated into larger systems that solve complex tasks. This work studies a simplified toy model of neural network learning in stochastic environments. Future work could be built on this basic framework to examine more complex reward distributions and sources of environmental variability.\nMoreover, a greater degree of biological realism could be added by studying more plausible network architectures (multiple plastic layers, recurrent and feedback connections) and more sophisticated plasticity rule parametrizations. Additionally, our foraging simulations were constrained by limited computational resources and were far from exhaustive.\nFurther experiments can investigate environments with different constraints, food distributions, multiple seasons, more complex motor control systems and interactions of those systems with different sensory networks as well as the inclusion of plasticity on the motor parts of the artificial organisms.",
                "The evolutionary balance between innate and learned behaviors is highly intricate, and different organisms have found different solutions to this problem. We hypothesize that the emergence and exact form of learning behaviors is naturally connected with the statistics of environmental fluctuations and tasks an organism needs to solve.\nHere, we study how different aspects of simulated environments shape an evolved synaptic plasticity rule in static and moving artificial agents. We demonstrate that environmental fluctuation and uncertainty control the reliance of artificial organisms on plasticity. Interestingly, the form of the emerging plasticity rule is additionally determined by the details of the task the artificial organisms are aiming to solve.\nMoreover, we show that coevolution between static connectivity and interacting plasticity mechanisms in distinct sub-networks changes the function and form of the emerging plasticity rules in embodied agents performing a foraging task. One of the defining features of living organisms is their ability to adapt to their environment and incorporate new information to modify their behavior.\nIt is unclear how the ability to learn first evolved , but its utility appears evident. Natural environments are too complex for all the necessary information to be hardcoded genetically and more importantly, they keep changing during an organism's lifetime in ways that cannot be anticipated ; . The link between learning and environmental uncertainty and fluctuation has been extensively demonstrated in both natural ; , and artificial environments .\nNevertheless, the ability to learn does not come without costs. For the capacity to learn to be beneficial in evolutionary terms, a costly nurturing period is often required, a phenomenon observed in both biological , and artificial organisms . Additionally, it has been shown that in some complex environments, hardcoded behaviors may be superior to learned ones given limits in the agent's lifetime and envi-ronmental uncertainty ; ; .\nThe theoretical investigation of the optimal balance between learned and innate behaviors in natural and artificial systems goes back several decades. However, it has recently found also a wide range of applications in applied AI systems ; . Most AI systems are trained for specific tasks, and have no need for modification after their training has been completed.\nStill, technological advances and the necessity to solve broad families of tasks make discussions about life-like AI systems relevant to a wide range of potential application areas. Thus the idea of open-ended AI agents that can continually interact with and adapt to changing environments has become particularly appealing.",
                "A final factor that affects the learning rate the EA will converge to is the frequency of environmental change during an agent's lifetime. Since the environmental change is modeled as a simple, two-state Markov process (Fig. ), the control parameter is the transition probability p tr . When keeping everything else the same, the learning rate rapidly rises as we increase the transition probability from 0, and after reaching a peak, it begins to decline slowly, eventually reaching zero (Fig. ).\nThis means that when environmental transition is very rare, agents opt for a very low learning rate, allowing a slow and stable convergence to an environment-appropriate weight vector that leads to very low losses while the agent remains in that environment. As the rate of environmental transition increases, faster learning is required to speed up convergence in order to exploit the (comparatively shorter) stays in each environment.\nFinally, as the environmental transition becomes too fast, the agents opt for slower or even no learning, which keeps them ) and the decision (b.) tasks, for a variety of parameters (p tr = 0.01, d e \u2208 0, 0.1, . . . , 1, and \u03c3 \u2208 0, 0.1, . . . , 1 in all 100 combinations). Despite the relatively small difference between the tasks, the evolved learning rules differ considerably.\nFor visual guidance, the lines connect \u03b8s from the same run. near the middle of the two environments, ensuring that the average loss of the two environments is minimal (Fig. ). The form of the evolved learning rule depends on the task: Decision vs. Prediction The plasticity parameters \u03b8 = (\u03b8 1 , . . . , \u03b8 8 ) for the rewardprediction task converge on approximately the same point, regardless of the environmental parameters (Fig. ).\nIn particular, \u03b8 3 \u2192 1, \u03b8 5 \u2192 \u22121, \u03b8 i \u2192 0 for all other i, and thus the learning rule converges to: Since by definition y t = g(W t X T t ) = W t X T t (g(x) = x in this experiment) and R t = W c X T t + \u03be we get: Thus the distribution of \u2206W t converges to a distribution with mean 0 and variance depending on \u03b7 p and \u03c3 and W converges to W c .",
                "The fitness of an agent (measured as the total food consumed over its lifetime) increases over generations of the EA for both the scalar and binary readouts in the sensory network. e. The Pearson correlation coefficient of an evolved agent's weights with the ingredient value vector of the current environment (E 1 -blue, E 2 -red).\nIn this example, the agent's weights are anti-correlated with its environment, which is not an issue for performance since the motor network can interpret the inverted signs of food. The agents can solve the task effectively by evolving a functional motor network and a plasticity rule that converges to interpretable weights (Fig. ).\nAfter \u223c 100 evolutionary steps (Fig. ), the agents can learn the ingredient value distribution using the plastic network and reliably move towards foods with positive values while avoiding the ones with negative values. We compare the dependence of the moving and the static agents on the parameters of the environment: d e and the state transition probability p tr .\nAt first, in order to simplify the experiment, we set the transition probability to 0, but fixed the initial weights to be the average of E 1 and E 2 , while the real state is E 2 . In this experiment, the distance between states d e indicates twice the distance between the agent's initial weights and the optimal weights (the environment's ingredient values) since the agent is initialized at the mean of the two environment distributions.\nSame as for the static agent, the learning rate increases with the distance d e (Fig. ). Then, we examine the effect of the environmental transition probability p tr on the evolved learning rate \u03b7 p . In order for an agent to get sufficient exposure to each environment, we scale down the probability p tr from the equivalent experiment for the static agents.\nWe find that as the probability of transition increases, the evolved learning rate \u03b7 p decreases (Fig. ). This fits with the larger trend for the static agent, although there is a clear difference when it comes to the increase for very small transition probabil-ities that were clearly identifiable in the static but not the moving agents.\nThis could be due to much sparser data and possibly the insufficiently long lifetime of the moving agent (the necessity of scaling makes direct comparisons difficult). Nevertheless, overall we see that the associations observed in the static agents between environmental distance d e and transition probability p tr and the evolved learning rate \u03b7 p are largely maintained in the moving agents.",
                "More precisely, we define two ingredient-value distributions E 1 and E 2 and switch between them, with probability p tr for every time step. We control how (dis)similar the environments are by parametrically setting E 2 = (1 \u2212 2d e )E 1 , with d e \u2208 [0, 1] serving as a distance proxy for the environments; when d e = 0, the environment remains unchanged, and when d e = 1 the value of each ingredient fully reverses when the environmental transition happens.\nFor simplicity, we take values of the ingredients in E 1 equally spaced between -1 and 1 (for the visualization, see Fig. ). The static agent receives passively presented food as a vector of ingredients and can assess its compound value using the linear summation of its sensors with the (learned or evolved) weights, see Fig. .\nThe network consists of N sensory neurons that are projecting to a single post-synaptic neuron. At each time step, an input X t = (x 1 , . . . , x N ) is presented, were the value x i , i \u2208 {1, . . . , N } represents the quantity of the ingredient i. We draw x i independently form a uniform distribution on the [0, 1] interval (x i \u223c U (0, 1)).\nThe value of each ingredient w c i is determined by the environment (E 1 or E 2 ). The postsynaptic neuron outputs a prediction of the food X t value as y t = g(W X T t ). Throughout the paper, g will be either the identity function, in which case the prediction neuron is linear, or a step-function; however, it could be any other nonlinearity, such as a sigmoid or ReLU.\nAfter outputting the prediction, the neuron receives feedback in the form of the real value of the input R t . The real value is computed as R t = W c X T t + \u03be, where W c = (w c 1 , . . . , w c N ) is the actual value of the ingredients, and \u03be is a term summarizing the noise of reward and sensing system \u03be \u223c N (0, \u03c3).",
                "So this learning rule will match the agent's weight vector with the vector of ingredient values in the environment. We examine the robustness of the learning rule the EA discovers by considering a slight modification of our task. Instead of predicting the expected food value, the agent now needs to decide whether to eat the presented food or not.\nThis is done by introducing a step-function nonlinearity (g(x) = 1 if x \u2265 1 and 0 otherwise). Then the output y(t) is computed as: Instead of the MSE loss between prediction and actual value, the fitness of the agent is now defined as the sum of the food values it chose to consume (by giving y t = 1). Besides these two changes, the setup of the experiments remains exactly the same.\nThe qualitative relation between \u03b7 p and parameters of environment d e , \u03c3 and p tr is preserved in the changed experiment. However, the resulting learning rule is significantly different (Fig. ). The evolution converges to the following learning rule: In both cases, the rule has the form \u2206W t = \u03b7 p X t [\u03b1 y R t + \u03b2 y ].\nThus, the \u2206W t is positive or negative depending on whether the reward R t is above or below a threshold (\u03b3 = \u2212\u03b2 y /\u03b1 y ) that depends on the output decision of the network (y t = 0 or 1). Both learning rules (for the reward-prediction and decision tasks) have a clear Hebbian form (coordination of preand post-synaptic activity) and use the incoming reward signal as a threshold.\nThese similarities indicate some common organizing principles of reward-modulated learning rules, but their significant differences highlight the sensitivity of the optimization process to task details. We now turn to the moving embodied agents in the 2D environment. To optimize these agents, both the motor network's connections and the sensory network's plasticity parameters evolve simultaneously.\nSince the motor network is initially random and the agent has to move to find food, the number of interactions an agent experiences in its lifetime can be small, slowing down the learning. However, having the larger motor network also has benefits for evolution because it allows the output of the plastic network to be read out and transformed in different ways, resulting in a broad set of solutions.",

                "Many different approaches for introducing lifelong learning in artificial agents have been proposed. Some of them draw direct inspiration from actual biological systems ; . Among them, the most biologically plausible solution is to equip artificial neural networks with some local neural plasticity , similar to the large variety of synaptic plasticity mechanisms ; ; that performs the bulk of the learning in the brains of living organisms .\nThe artificial plasticity mechanisms can be optimized to modify the connectivity of the artificial neural networks toward solving a particular task. The optimization can use a variety of approaches, most commonly evolutionary computation. The idea of meta-learning or optimizing synaptic plasticity rules to perform specific functions has been recently established as an engineering tool that can compete with stateof-the-art machine learning algorithms on various complex tasks ; ; Pedersen and Risi (2021); .\nAdditionally, it can be used to reverse engineer actual plasticity mechanisms found in biological neural networks and uncover their functions ; . Here, we study the effect that different factors (environ-arXiv:2303.06734v1 [q-bio.NC] 12 Mar 2023 mental fluctuation and reliability, task complexity) have on the form of evolved functional reward-modulated plasticity rules.\nWe investigate the evolution of plasticity rules in static, single-layer simple networks. Then we increase the complexity by switching to moving agents performing a complex foraging task. In both cases, we study the impact of different environmental parameters on the form of the evolved plasticity mechanisms and the interaction of learned and static network connectivity.\nInterestingly, we find that different environmental conditions and different combinations of static and plastic connectivity have a very large impact on the resulting plasticity rules. We imagine an agent who must forage to survive in an environment presenting various types of complex food particles. Each food particle is composed of various amounts and combinations of N ingredients that can have positive (food) or negative (poison) values.\nThe value of a food particle is a weighted sum of its ingredients. To predict the reward value of a given resource, the agent must learn the values of these ingredients by interacting with the environment. The priors could be generated by genetic memory, but the exact values are subject to change. To introduce environmental variability, we stochastically change the values of the ingredients.",
                "After 5000 time steps, the cumulative reward of the agent (the sum of the values of all the food it consumed) is taken as its fitness. During the evolutionary optimization, the parameters for both the motor network (connections) and plastic network (learning rule parameters) are co-evolved, and so agents must simultaneously learn to move and discriminate good/bad food.\nReward-modulated plasticity is one of the most promising explanations for biological credit assignment . In our network, the plasticity rule that updates the weights of the linear sensor network is a rewardmodulated rule which is parameterized as a linear combination of the input, the output, and the reward at each time step:\nAdditionally, after each plasticity step, the weights are normalized by mean subtraction, an important step for the stabilization of Hebbian-like plasticity rules . We use a genetic algorithm to optimize the learning rate \u03b7 p and amplitudes of different terms \u03b8 = (\u03b8 1 , . . . , \u03b8 8 ). The successful plasticity rule after many food presentations must converge to a weight vector that predicts the correct food values (or allows the agent to correctly decide whether to eat a food or avoid it).\nTo have comparable results, we divide \u03b8 = (\u03b8 1 , . . . , \u03b8 8 ) by We then multiply the learning rate \u03b7 p with \u03b8 max to maintain the rule's evolved form unchanged, \u03b7 norm p = \u03b7 p \u2022 \u03b8 max . In the following, we always use normalized \u03b7 p and \u03b8, omitting norm . To evolve the plasticity rule and the moving agents' motor networks, we use a simple genetic algorithm with elitism .\nThe agents' parameters are initialized at random (drawn from a Gaussian distribution), then the sensory network is trained by the plasticity rule and finally, the agents are evaluated. After each generation, the bestperforming agents (top 10 % of the population size) are selected and copied into the next generation.\nThe remaining 90 % of the generation is repopulated with mutated copies of the best-performing agents. We mutate agents by adding independent Gaussian noise (\u03c3 = 0.1) to its parameters. To start with, we consider a static agent whose goal is to identify the value of presented food correctly. The static reward-prediction network quickly evolves the parameters of the learning rule, successfully solving the prediction task.",
                "Figure : An outline of the static agent's network. The sensor layer receives inputs representing the quantity of each ingredient of a given food at each time step. The agent computes the prediction of the food's value y t and is then given the true value R t ; it finally uses this information in the plasticity rule to update the weight matrix.\nFor the evolutionary adjustment of the agent's parameters, the loss of the static agent is the sum of the mean squared errors (MSE) between its prediction y t and the reward R t over the lifetime of the agent. The agent's initial weights are set to the average of the two ingredient value distributions, which is the optimal initial value for the case of symmetric switching of environments that we consider here.\nAs a next step, we incorporate the sensory network of static agents into embodied agents that can move around in an environment scattered with food. To this end, we merge the static agent's network with a second, non-plastic motor network that is responsible for controlling the motion of the agent in the environment.\nSpecifically, the original plastic network now provides the agent with information about the value of the nearest food. The embodied agent has additional sensors for the distance from the nearest food, the angle between the current velocity and the nearest food direction, its own velocity, and its own energy level (sum of consumed food values).\nThese inputs are processed by two hidden layers (of 30 and 15 neurons) with tanh activation. The network's outputs are angular and linear acceleration, Fig. . The embodied agents spawn in a 2D space with periodic boundary conditions along with a number of food particles that are selected such that the mean of the food value distribution is \u223c 0. An agent can eat food by approaching it sufficiently closely, and each time a food particle is eaten, it is The sensor layer receives inputs at each time step (the ingredients of the nearest food), which are processed by the plastic layer in the same way as the static sensory network, Fig. .\nThe output of that network is given as input to the motor network, along with the distance d and angle \u03b1 to the nearest food, the current velocity v, and energy E of the agent. These signals are processed through two hidden layers to the final output of motor commands as the linear and angular acceleration of the agent re-spawned with the same value somewhere randomly on the grid (following the setup of ).",
                "We find that different sources of variability have a strong impact on the extent to which evolving agents will develop neuronal plasticity mechanisms for adapting to their environment. A diverse environment, a reliable sensory system, and a rate of environmental change that is neither too large nor too small are necessary conditions for an agent to be able to effectively adapt via synaptic plasticity.\nAdditionally, we find that minor variations of the task an agent has to solve or the parametrization of the network can give rise to significantly different plasticity rules. Our results partially extend to embodied artificial agents performing a foraging task. We show that environmental variability also pushes the development of plasticity in such agents.\nStill, in contrast to the static agents, we find that the interaction of a static motor network with a plastic sensory network gives rise to a much greater variety of wellfunctioning learning rules. We propose a potential cause of this degeneracy; as the relatively complex motor network is allowed to read out and process the outputs from the plastic network, any consistent information coming out of these outputs can be potentially interpreted in a behaviorally useful way.\nReducing the information the motor network can extract from the sensory system significantly limits learning rule variability. Our findings on the effect of environmental variability concur with the findings of previous studies that have identified the constraints that environmental variability places on the evolutionary viability of learning behaviors.\nWe extend these findings in a mechanistic model which uses a biologically plausible learning mechanism (synaptic plasticity). We show how a simple evolutionary algorithm can optimize the different parameters of a simple reward-modulated plasticity rule for solving simple prediction and decision tasks.\nReward-modulated plasticity has been extensively studied as a plausible mechanism for credit assignment in the brain ; ; and has found several applications in artificial intelligence and robotics tasks ; . Here, we demonstrate how such rules can be very well-tuned to take into account different environmental parameters and produce optimal behavior in simple systems.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate how the co-evolution of plasticity and static functional connectivity in different subnetworks fundamentally changes the evolutionary pressures on the resulting plasticity rules, allowing for greater diversity in the form of the learning rule and the resulting learned connectivity."

                "The learning rate of a network's weight updates is influenced by three main factors: the distance between environments, the noisiness of rewards, and the rate of environmental transition. A larger distance between environments requires a higher learning rate, while higher reward noise (\u03c3) leads to a lower learning rate, sometimes resulting in no adaptation (\u03b7 p \u2248 0). This occurs when the expected loss from ignoring environmental changes is less than the loss from adapting based on noisy cues.",
                "The study explores the impact of environmental parameters on plasticity mechanisms in static and moving agents. In static agents, plasticity must accurately identify environmental value distributions for precise predictions, whereas moving agents require a representation that the motor network can interpret to make food consumption decisions. The analysis uses Pearson correlation coefficients between agent weights and ingredient values, avoiding MSE loss due to varying vector amplitudes. Results show that moving agents with anti-correlated weights perform as well as those with positively correlated weights, as the motor network can adapt to negative sensory inputs for food detection.",
                "The study examines how the addition of a motor network affects the plasticity rules evolved by embodied agents. Unlike static agents with structured rules, embodied agents exhibit virtually no discernible pattern or structure in their evolved rules. This is partly due to the motor network's ability to interpret sensory network outputs in various ways. To test this, a step-function nonlinearity was introduced, creating a binary output that reduced information flow from the sensory to the motor network. This change led to more structured plasticity rules and reduced variance in learned weights among the best-performing agents, indicating increased selection pressure for accurate learning of the environment's food distribution.",
                "Studies show that synaptic plasticity in biological networks is influenced by network topology and is highly redundant, meaning various learning rules can achieve the same neural connectivity. This redundancy implies that plasticity rules cannot be studied in isolation from network connectivity. Optimizing functional plasticity in neural networks is a promising research direction for understanding biological learning and enhancing artificial systems. Current research uses a simplified model in stochastic environments, suggesting reward-modulated plasticity's adaptability. Future work could explore more complex environments, network architectures, and plasticity rule parametrizations for greater biological realism. Additionally, further experiments could investigate diverse environmental constraints and interactions between motor control and sensory networks.",
                "The study explores the relationship between environmental fluctuations, tasks, and the emergence of learning behaviors in artificial organisms. It finds that environmental uncertainty and task specifics influence the reliance on synaptic plasticity and the form of the plasticity rules that evolve. Coevolution between static and plastic components in sub-networks further shapes these rules, particularly in foraging tasks. While learning offers adaptability, it comes with costs, such as a nurturing period, and may not always be superior to innate behaviors in complex environments. The theoretical balance between learned and innate behaviors has applications in AI, where adaptable, life-like systems are increasingly sought after for their potential in various tasks and environments.",
                "The learning rate of an evolutionary algorithm (EA) converges to different levels depending on the frequency of environmental changes experienced by the agent. When environmental transitions are rare, agents adopt a low learning rate for stable convergence to an optimal weight vector, minimizing losses. As the rate of environmental change increases, faster learning is necessary to quickly adapt to the shorter periods within each environment. However, if environmental transitions occur too rapidly, agents may slow down or stop learning altogether, maintaining a balance between the two environments to minimize average loss. The evolved learning rules vary significantly between decision and prediction tasks, with the plasticity parameters converging to specific values that depend on the task and environmental parameters.",
                "The fitness of agents, measured by food consumption over their lifetimes, improves over generations in both scalar and binary sensory networks. Agents evolve to have weights that are anti-correlated with their environment, which is not detrimental to performance due to the motor network's ability to interpret inverted signs. After approximately 100 evolutionary steps, agents can learn the ingredient value distribution and move towards positive-value foods while avoiding negative-value ones. The learning rate increases with the distance between states (d_e) and decreases with the environmental transition probability (p_tr), similar to static agents, though differences exist for very small transition probabilities. Overall, the associations between environmental factors and the evolved learning rate are largely maintained in moving agents.",
                "The study defines two ingredient-value distributions, E1 and E2, which switch with a probability p_tr at each time step. The environments' dissimilarity is controlled by setting E2 = (1 \u2212 2d_e)E1, where d_e \u2208 [0, 1] is a distance proxy. A static agent assesses food value by summing sensory inputs weighted by learned or evolved values. The network has N sensory neurons projecting to a single post-synaptic neuron, which predicts the food value using a linear summation or a step-function. After prediction, the neuron receives feedback with a real value computed as the weighted sum of ingredients plus noise.",

Despite changes, the learning rule maintains a Hebbian form, coordinating pre- and post-synaptic activity with the reward signal as a threshold. This similarity suggests common principles in reward-modulated learning, though task details significantly impact the rule. For moving agents in a 2D environment, both motor network connections and sensory network plasticity parameters evolve simultaneously, offering a broad range of solutions despite potential learning slowdowns due to random initial motor networks.",

Minor task variations or network parameters can lead to significantly different plasticity rules. Embodied agents performing foraging tasks also exhibit increased plasticity due to environmental variability. The interaction between static motor networks and plastic sensory networks results in a greater variety of effective learning rules, potentially due to the motor network's ability to interpret consistent sensory information. Reducing sensory information limits learning rule diversity. The study aligns with previous research on environmental constraints on learning behaviors and extends these findings using a biologically plausible synaptic plasticity model. It demonstrates how a simple evolutionary algorithm can optimize reward-modulated plasticity rules for prediction and decision tasks, showing their adaptability to different environmental parameters.

                        "The paper investigates how environmental variability and network structure influence the optimal plasticity mechanisms in embodied agents. The study focuses on a foraging agent controlled by a neural network, where the sensor layer processes inputs related to the nearest food, and the motor network generates movement commands. The plasticity rule parameters for reward prediction and decision-making tasks are evolved under various environmental conditions. The results show that the learning rate of the plastic sensory network increases with the distance between environments and decreases with the frequency of environmental change. The fitness of the agent improves over generations, and the weights of the evolved agent's sensory network exhibit correlations with the environment's ingredient values, which the motor network can interpret effectively.",
                        "The study explores the relationship between environmental fluctuations, tasks, and the emergence of learning behaviors in artificial organisms. It finds that environmental uncertainty and task specifics influence the reliance on synaptic plasticity and the form of the plasticity rules that evolve. Coevolution between static and plastic components in sub-networks further shapes these rules, particularly in foraging tasks. While learning offers adaptability, it comes with costs, such as a nurturing period, and may not always be superior to innate behaviors in complex environments. The theoretical balance between learned and innate behaviors has applications in AI, where adaptable, life-like systems are increasingly sought after for their potential in various tasks and environments.",
                        "The study explores the evolution of plasticity rules in artificial neural networks, inspired by biological synaptic plasticity mechanisms. These rules are optimized using evolutionary computation to solve specific tasks, potentially outperforming traditional machine learning algorithms. The research investigates how different environmental factors, such as fluctuation and reliability, and task complexity influence the form of evolved plasticity rules. Experiments are conducted on static networks and moving agents performing a complex foraging task. The findings reveal that environmental conditions and the combination of static and plastic connectivity significantly impact the resulting plasticity rules. The study uses a scenario where an agent must learn to forage in an environment with varying food particles, each composed of ingredients with positive or negative values, to understand how these factors shape the learning process.",
                        "The study defines two ingredient-value distributions, E1 and E2, which switch with a probability p_tr at each time step. The environments' dissimilarity is controlled by setting E2 = (1 \u2212 2d_e)E1, where d_e \u2208 [0, 1] is a distance proxy. A static agent assesses food value by summing sensory inputs weighted by learned or evolved values. The network has N sensory neurons projecting to a single post-synaptic neuron, which predicts the food value using a linear summation or a step-function. After prediction, the neuron receives feedback with a real value computed as the weighted sum of ingredients plus noise.",
                        "The figure outlines the network structure of a static agent that predicts the value of food based on ingredient quantities. The agent updates its weight matrix using a plasticity rule informed by the difference between its prediction and the true value. The agent's parameters are evolved based on the mean squared error (MSE) between its predictions and the actual rewards over its lifetime. The initial weights are set to the average of ingredient value distributions, optimal for symmetric environment switching.\n\nNext, the static agent's network is integrated into an embodied agent capable of movement. This embodied agent combines the static network with a non-plastic motor network for motion control. The embodied agent receives additional sensory inputs such as distance to the nearest food, angle, velocity, and energy level. These inputs are processed through two hidden layers to produce motor commands for linear and angular acceleration. The agents operate in a 2D space with periodic boundary conditions, consuming food particles that respawn randomly.",
                        "The agent's fitness is determined by its cumulative reward after 5000 time steps, which reflects the total value of food consumed. Both the motor network and plastic network parameters are co-evolved, requiring the agent to learn movement and food discrimination simultaneously. The plasticity rule, which updates the sensor network weights, is a reward-modulated linear combination of input, output, and reward, followed by mean subtraction for stabilization. A genetic algorithm optimizes the learning rate and amplitudes of different terms. Normalization of parameters ensures consistent results. The genetic algorithm with elitism selects the top 10% best-performing agents for the next generation, while the remaining 90% are mutated copies. Initial random parameters are trained by the plasticity rule, and the static reward-prediction network quickly evolves to solve the prediction task.",
                        "The learning rate of a network's weight updates is influenced by three main factors: the distance between environments, the noisiness of rewards, and the rate of environmental transition. A larger distance between environments requires a higher learning rate, while higher reward noise (\u03c3) leads to a lower learning rate, sometimes resulting in no adaptation (\u03b7 p \u2248 0). This occurs when the expected loss from ignoring environmental changes is less than the loss from adapting based on noisy cues.",
                        "The learning rate of an evolutionary algorithm (EA) converges to different levels depending on the frequency of environmental changes experienced by the agent. When environmental transitions are rare, agents adopt a low learning rate for stable convergence to an optimal weight vector, minimizing losses. As the rate of environmental change increases, faster learning is necessary to quickly adapt to the shorter periods within each environment. However, if environmental transitions occur too rapidly, agents may slow down or stop learning altogether, maintaining a balance between the two environments to minimize average loss. The evolved learning rules vary significantly between decision and prediction tasks, with the plasticity parameters converging to specific values that depend on the task and environmental parameters."

                        "The learning rule developed for an agent to match its weight vector with ingredient values in the environment is tested for robustness by modifying the task. Instead of predicting food value, the agent must decide whether to eat or not, using a step-function nonlinearity. The fitness is now based on the sum of consumed food values. Despite changes, the learning rule maintains a Hebbian form, coordinating pre- and post-synaptic activity with the reward signal as a threshold. This similarity suggests common principles in reward-modulated learning, though task details significantly impact the rule. For moving agents in a 2D environment, both motor network connections and sensory network plasticity parameters evolve simultaneously, offering a broad range of solutions despite potential learning slowdowns due to random initial motor networks.",
                        "The fitness of agents, measured by food consumption over their lifetimes, improves over generations in both scalar and binary sensory networks. Agents evolve to have weights that are anti-correlated with their environment, which is not detrimental to performance due to the motor network's ability to interpret inverted signs. After approximately 100 evolutionary steps, agents can learn the ingredient value distribution and move towards positive-value foods while avoiding negative-value ones. The learning rate increases with the distance between states (d_e) and decreases with the environmental transition probability (p_tr), similar to static agents, though differences exist for very small transition probabilities. Overall, the associations between environmental factors and the evolved learning rate are largely maintained in moving agents.",
                        "The study explores the impact of environmental parameters on plasticity mechanisms in static and moving agents. In static agents, plasticity must accurately identify environmental value distributions for precise predictions, whereas moving agents require a representation that the motor network can interpret to make food consumption decisions. The analysis uses Pearson correlation coefficients between agent weights and ingredient values, avoiding MSE loss due to varying vector amplitudes. Results show that moving agents with anti-correlated weights perform as well as those with positively correlated weights, as the motor network can adapt to negative sensory inputs for food detection.",
                        "The study examines how the addition of a motor network affects the plasticity rules evolved by embodied agents. Unlike static agents with structured rules, embodied agents exhibit virtually no discernible pattern or structure in their evolved rules. This is partly due to the motor network's ability to interpret sensory network outputs in various ways. To test this, a step-function nonlinearity was introduced, creating a binary output that reduced information flow from the sensory to the motor network. This change led to more structured plasticity rules and reduced variance in learned weights among the best-performing agents, indicating increased selection pressure for accurate learning of the environment's food distribution.",
                        "The study explores how various sources of variability influence the development of neuronal plasticity in evolving agents. Key factors include a diverse environment, reliable sensory systems, and an optimal rate of environmental change. Minor task variations or network parameters can lead to significantly different plasticity rules. Embodied agents performing foraging tasks also exhibit increased plasticity due to environmental variability. The interaction between static motor networks and plastic sensory networks results in a greater variety of effective learning rules, potentially due to the motor network's ability to interpret consistent sensory information. Reducing sensory information limits learning rule diversity. The study aligns with previous research on environmental constraints on learning behaviors and extends these findings using a biologically plausible synaptic plasticity model. It demonstrates how a simple evolutionary algorithm can optimize reward-modulated plasticity rules for prediction and decision tasks, showing their adaptability to different environmental parameters. The co-evolution of plasticity and static connectivity in subnetworks enhances evolutionary pressures, leading to greater diversity in learning rules and learned connectivity.",
                        "Studies show that synaptic plasticity in biological networks is influenced by network topology and is highly redundant, meaning various learning rules can achieve the same neural connectivity. This redundancy implies that plasticity rules cannot be studied in isolation from network connectivity. Optimizing functional plasticity in neural networks is a promising research direction for understanding biological learning and enhancing artificial systems. Current research uses a simplified model in stochastic environments, suggesting reward-modulated plasticity's adaptability. Future work could explore more complex environments, network architectures, and plasticity rule parametrizations for greater biological realism. Additionally, further experiments could investigate diverse environmental constraints and interactions between motor control and sensory networks."

                "Three days later, I flew to his place about 400 miles away to take a look at his project. At this point I should probably mention that I consider myself to be fairly knowledgeable about airplane construction, although the vast majority of my experience is with tube and fabric. The rest of this article deals with what I looked for and more importantly what I missed and have had to repair in the last year since I purchased the project.\nWhen we went to the seller's house, I found that the left wing was built using the Dan Diehl wing skins and the right wing skins were leaning against the wall inside the house. Also the canopy was in the house with the canopy covered with paper and tape. I wanted to inspect the fuselage first, so off we went to the shop.\nThere I found a fuselage sitting on it's gear painted in primer gray. The first step was to inspect the quality of workmanship of what could be seen as it sat. The interior of the fuselage looked as if it had been built with a great deal of care. The fit and finish of all of the interior wood was very nice. Even the gussets looked like they had been painstakingly perfectly fitted. The glass work on the turtle back also looked very precise and clean. It was evenly faired into the vertical and horizontal stabs. The tail also appeared to be well built with the exception of a depression directly over the front and rear spars in the horizontal stabs. He explained that when he moved recently, that he had shot the plane with gray primer to protect it from the weather since he wouldn't have ready access to a shop to put it in right away. It ended up sitting out in the hot south Texas summer sun for a few weeks before he got a shop rented to work in. That caused the glass (or possibly the foam inside the horizontal stab) to swell, except that it held onto the spar, so it was slightly ballooned in front of and behind the spars. His recommendation was to fill it back smooth with micro.",
                "I decided that I had to remove the rear fittings from the left wing to be replaced with the new set that my neighborhood machinist was cutting out for me. When I put the wing on the work bench to start removing the rear fittings, I thought I had better take a closer look at the bubbles in the leading edge. I found that as I pushed on the leading edge, it delaminated between the glass lay-up on top and the upper and lower wing skin edges that were floxed together underneath. I concluded that that area had to come apart and took a belt sander to the leading edge. What I found was that the leading edge had been floxed together and glassed over, but the mold release had never been scrubbed off the leading edge of the wing. It peeled apart for rebuild quite easily.\nWhen I got back to removing the rear spar attach fittings, I noticed that the woodwork inside the wing looked awfully dull. The reason was that the wing had been closed up without varnishing any of the woodwork. This was rectified with a small hole saw, a number of extensions and a modified undercoating sprayer.\nI also found that the aluminum drain fitting in the bottom of the left wing tank had been glassed into place upside down. The tapered pipe threads were tapered the wrong way to install the draincock into the tank. Retapping the fitting the right direction seemed to be a good fix for that problem.\nWhen I finally got around to attaching the wing to the fuselage, I found that the front spar attach fittings were badly misaligned. Although they could be forced into alignment, I didn't think I needed that kind of preload on the main spar fittings. This problem was fixed by calling on my local neighborhood machinist to build me an aligning fixture and reaming the attach holes to the next larger size and ordering the new sized bolts.\nOn the fuselage I found that although it had new Cleveland wheels and brakes on it, one of the brakes had a severe wobble to it. I must complement the manufacturers for taking care of that problem. One call to the Cleveland factory and they shipped me a new set of wheels and brakes even though the receipt for this set was over four years old and in the original builders name. Their only concern was that this set had never been placed in service yet.",
                "This year's KR Forum featured guest speakers Mike Stearns, Steve Trentman, and Bill Marcey. Mike Stearns spoke on several topics, including the many sources for KR and homebuilding information available on the Internet. He also mentioned KRNet, the list server devoted entirely to KR aircraft, as well as several notable World Wide Web home pages. He also brought a sample of the new Rand Robinson wing skins with him, and discussed their high temperature core prepreg construction. His KR2S will receive the first set, which is currently being installed at Hinson Composites.\nSteve Trentman spoke on his turbine installation. It uses a turbine engine which saw duty as an A7 attack jet starter engine. Total weight is about 85 pounds, while putting out around 90 horsepower. There is a small stockpile of these engines available from government surplus. sources. This engine can only be throttled back to 52% power, which leads to some pretty interesting landings. One inflight failure has been logged so far, with very little damage to the aircraft. More on this exciting development in next month's issue of KROnline.\nLes Palmer's KR2 N202LP won Best KR2, Best Engine Installation, and People's Choice awards at the 1995 KR Gathering at Columbia, TN. After researching the KR series, and reading Neil Bingham's \"A Critical Analysis of the KR2\" (Jan 88 Sport Aviation), Les decided to build his as a single seater, stretched 24\" in the tail, while maintaining a stock width firewall. His fuselage is made from Douglas fir, which weighs in at 4 lbs heavier than if constructed from spruce. It is skinned with 1/8\" birch plywood. Spars are covered with plywoood on both fore and aft sides, ala KR2S. Diehl wing skins provide the lift. Horizontal stabilizer and elevator were stretched 7\" longer on each side, while the vertical stabilizer and rudder were stretched 8\" taller. . The fuselage to cowling junction was made more graceful by adding 1.5 inches to the height of the firewall end of the fuselage sides.\nLes's canopy is a Dragonfly, using a four linkage system to swing forward when opening. The canopy frame fits snugly into a recess in the foward deck, providing an excellent wind and water seal. The fiberglass work is exemplary.\nSeating is luxurious for one.",
                "At this point the turtledeck looked great and only weighed about 5lbs. but I noticed you could deform the skin by pushing hard on the outside. So I flipped the turtledeck over and from 1/4 inch last-a-foam, I cut two inch wide strips that would run the entire length, forward and aft inside the turtledeck. In effect these would act as composite stringers, I made enough of these two inch wide strips to make up three stringers. One down the center (sort of a backbone) and one on each side of the \"backbone\" half the distance to the edge of the turtledeck. I sanded the edge of the foam so that when covered with a layer of bid @ 45degrees there would be a nice transition from the turtledeck skin up onto the foam and then back onto the turtledeck I scuff sanded and glued the foam stringers in with micro. I covered the foam stringers with one layer of 8oz bid @ 45degrees.",
                "I chose to sand the load of micro off the left wing to see what it was covering. When I got down to the glass, I found that there was no glass for the aft inch and a half of the underside of the wing in front of the aileron hinge. With the Diehl wing skins, you build the wings, then cut the ailerons out of trailing edge of the wing. He had mismeasured and cut too much material off the bottom side of the trailing edge in front of the aileron. It was filled by floxing a piece of spruce into the gap to fill the space between the back edge of the fiberglass and the aileron mount. I chose to wrap the trailing edge of that wing, and the other wing to match with a couple of lay-ups of glass.\nWhen I sanded the primer off the aforementioned damaged trim tab, I found that the hinge was floxed to the leading edge of the foam insides of the tab, but not the glass. I also chose to wrap the front of the trim tab with a lay-up of glass.\nI decided to pull the paper off the canopy and take a look at it before I'm ready to bolt it on and fly. The original builder had blown his own canopy and after some of the previous problems, I was beginning to have some concerns about not having looked it over closely enough. The canopy turned out to have been blow a little too large. It ended up with a little larger bubble for headroom, which I didn't object to. However, it had more headroom on the right side than the left. Yes, it was just a little bit lopsided. The main problem was that the canopy is stretched thin enough that it can be easily pushed in with one hand when the weather is warm.. My fear was that this is just thin enough that it may decide to lay on my head or in my lap when flying on a warm day. It will have to be replaced.",
                "At each station, start by marking off each short (bottom longeron) line distance from the centerline. Use your set of trammels or beam compass for doing this. Mark the intersection of the short line with the station line.\nAt each station, mark off each long (top longeron) line distance from the intersection of the short line distance and the station line. Again the trammels or beam compass is best for completing this step. Mark the intersection of the long line distance with the station line.\nUsing the longeron as a batten, trace out the inside and outside curves of the longeron. After the batten is secure, in between each station, fasten a keeper block inside and outside to preserve the shape of the longeron taking care to avoid potential future interference with the diagonal members to be installed later. The fairing blocks can be removed or left in place if they won't interfere with building. The vertical station members and their diagonals can now be measured and positioned. Remember to refer to the plans for the material thickness direction.\nAfter vertical and diagonal members are cut and fitted, take time to draw their outlines on the building surface to cut down on time and confusion when laying out the opposite side.\nFinishing the side panel is accomplished in a manner similar to that called for in the handbook with the exception that the side and bottom skin panels will be attached later.\nThe next article in the series will discuss jigging and building techniques to ensure alignment and straightness of the flat built side panels.

                "Over the past twenty years I've owned a number of planes, but still always wanted to build my own. I needed one that would fit me, my budget requirements, and have the speed and performance that I wanted. When \"KITPLANES\" published the article featuring Roy Marsh's new KR-2S, it was the first I had heard of any major modifications or improvements to the same old KR design. I believe that article and Roy Marsh's workmanship have probably been the greatest boon to Rand Robinson (RR) in the last twenty years. It certainly caught my eye! Here was the same design I had decided I wanted to build twenty years ago, with all of the improvements I wanted. It was sitting on fixed gear with some reasonable ground clearance. It had the capability to be built large enough to accommodate me. It has enough prefab parts available that it didn't have to be 100% scratch built if I decided to hurry the project along. And it had the speed I wanted. I knew that Roy's published speeds were probably not realistic expectations for the average KR, but after knocking around for the last three years in my Champ, anything over 90 mph seems pretty fast to me.\nAfter purchasing the info kit and the sales video from Rand Robinson, the next step after deciding for sure to build this plane was to order the KR-2 plans and the KR-2S addendum. I finally got my plans and was putting together my first order to start the plane, when my partner in the Champ pointed out that there was a partially completed KR-2S for sale in Trade-a-plane. My initial answer was \"No, I don't even want to look at it. I want to build my own from scratch.\" My partner insisted that for the advertised price and the fact that it wasn't too far away, I ought to at least give the guy a call and investigate it. \"No, I don't think I want to buy someone else's problems,\" I persisted. That night I went home and crunched up some numbers on the calculator and finally came to the conclusion that for the sake of my budget for the next several years, I really should give this guy a call.",
                "At this point it was starting to get late and my ride down needed to get airborne for the flight home. I needed to make a decision about whether I wanted this project or not, but I hadn't inspected the wings and canopy yet. I took a cursory look at the left wing and saw lots on micro built up on it and some bubbles in the leading edge, but nothing that looked seriously wrong to my amateur eye. The right wing was only a set of spars in the shop and the Diehl wing skins in the house, so there wasn't much to look at there. The canopy was wrapped in paper and tape, so there wasn't much to look at there either. I decided that even if there were serious problems in the wing that was built, I would be money ahead to go ahead and buy the project. For the advertised price, I could build a new set of wings and still be way ahead financially. We negotiated a final price, shook hands, took my ride to the airport, and started off in search of a U-haul to haul the project home.\nNow, at this point, some of you are thinking about what I surely must have forgotten to inspect and why didn't I take a local A & P or EAA member along for the ride. First of all, I don't know any mechanics locally that have any experience with glass and our EAA chapter of which I am VP is woefully lacking in fiberglass knowledge. Secondly, as you will see, I missed plenty. Some by ignorance, some by just not looking close enough.\nNow for a list of the problems that I found over the last year and a few of the fixes that I came up with.",
                "I found that the lower set of rear spar attach fittings on the left rear spar were installed backwards with the longer spaced hole towards the fuselage. Since this is the same place that also had the cracked spar cap, it required a major change. Also in the same area he had drilled through the rear spar with a hole saw to create a place for the aileron cable to pass through and managed to cut out the second from the outside vertical brace in the spar. Then he chose to install the aileron bellcranks in front of the rear spar, and cut another hole through the rear spar for the aileron push rod. He also managed to cut out the outside vertical brace in the spar. Since the holes were already drilled through the spar, the choices were to either cut out that section of spar cap and scarf a new piece in, cut the whole rear spar carrythrough out of the fuselage including ruining the left lower wing skin, or do something else creative to reinforce the spar cap and install a custom built set of attach fittings.\nI also found that after I built and installed the right side wing stub ribs and skin that the aileron bellcrank setup would not work as installed. The cable that crosses between the two bellcranks had a sharp uphill from the sheeve to the bellcrank in the last 12 inches on either side. This combined with the radius that the bellcranks turn caused the cross cable to pull up tight when the ailerons were pushed to either end of their travel, but allowed the cables to go very slack when the ailerons were centered. Also the Aileron pushrods needed to pass directly through the lower set of rear wing attach fittings to attach to the aileron. This whole rear spar and aileron bellcrank setup was going to either have to be redesigned or cut out and built to plans. The bottom line is that the problems I observed when I inspected this part were much more serious than expected when I had to fix it.",
                "I'm sure that many that are reading this could see several of the potential problems before I mentioned them, but some others may not have and I'm sure that there could have been many other problems that didn't but could have existed on this project. This is also not intended to be critical of the gentleman that started this project as many parts of it, especially the wood work are better than I could have done and much of his work is outstanding. I prefer to think that I'll end up with a better plane with his woodwork combined with my glasswork. This article is intended to feature some of the problems that you may run into in buying someone else's project.\nThe final question is, knowing what I have found over the past year, would I have still purchased this project. The answer is yes, but primarily because the price was right in that I am still money and work ahead of where I would be if I had started the project from scratch. There are a few things that I would have done differently, but nothing that I can't live with. Although I won't be able to say that I built it all from scratch, I have built and rebuild enough of the plane that I should have no problem qualifying under the 51% rule.\nYou can send comments directly to the author via e-mail at \"jscott@LANL.GOV\".\nHere is an brief explanation of how I built my turtledecks. The jig was constructed from scrap plywood and a few 1x4s that I ripped into stringers. I made two temporary bulkheads from the plywood, one for each end. Remember the forward bulkhead needs to be shaped in a way that will closely match the aft end of your canopy frame. Make an aft bulkhead by placing a straight edge at the top of your forward bulkhead and the trailing edge of your horizontal stabilizer. This will give you an idea of how tall your aft bulkhead needs to be. As far as location, I placed my aft bulkhead just forward of the lower/front of my vertical fin. I constructed the jig on the fuselage, it is glued together with automotive bondo.",
                "\"Scarfing\" is the practice of splicing plywood so that short pieces of plywood can be used to span long distances. On the KR, it is required on both the fuselage skins and spar webs. The angle of the splice should be 10 to 12 degrees to maintain strength across the joint. Also, joints should coincide with structural members, such as spar webs or fuselage truss members.\nThis scarfer is made by mating a regular plunge router (this one costs about $50) to a table saw. Obviously, you really only need a table saw to cut the chamfer, but it does make a nice heavy table for scarfing. You could just as easily use a large work table as the base.First, set the table saw for a 5.5 degree cut (for a 1:12 joint, or 6.5 degree cut for a 10:1 joint), and run a 1 x 6 through on edge to chamfer a corner on the board. Then drill the board for three router mounting holes (two are countersunk) and connect the assembly to the table saw with two 1/4 inch bolts. Use a long (2-3 inch) straight cutting bit to do the cutting. Adjust the bit so it doesn't interfere with your table top, and go to town. Keep pressure on the plywood to ensure contact with the table while you're scarfing. Make sure you feed your material from the same end as you would if you were sawing, or the router will take your plywood away from you and put a big dent in your garage door.\nIn the late 60's Ken Rand and Stuart Robinson were working as flight system engineers for Douglas Avionics. Ken was working as an electrical engineer, having previously worked for Sperry as an autopilots project engineer, while Stu's degree was in aeronautical engineering from Northrop University. They were two of the guys at the end of the DC-8,9, and 10 assembly lines responsible for correcting some of the nits and picks in various systems before delivery to the customer.",
                "The cowling is also a work of art, and uses NACA ducts for efficiency. Female molds were made for all the fiberglass parts on Les's plane, so he could proabably be persuaded to make more, if demand dictates. Les also machines a multitude of KR aluminum and steel parts which he now offers for sale.\nThe firewall was reinforced with aluminum brackets and angles bolted between the longerons in anticipation of the 200 lb Subaru EA-81 engine installation. His 100 HP Asian version is outfitted with an American Holley 5200 caburetor and manifold. It uses a PSRU of Les's own design, featuring two spur gears with a 1.69:1 reduction ratio and a toothed belt. Other than tapping the crank for larger bolts to mount the redrive, no other engine modifications were required. Also, this is probably the only air conditioned KR2 on the planet. The prop is a 60/63 Hegy.\nOriginally built as a taildragger, the fixed gear is made from 4130 steel tubing. Custom cast 6.00x6 aluminum wheels and steel rotors are mated with 6\" Cleveland calipers for braking. An early taxi test accident damaged the main gear, and prompted Les to change to tricycle gear. Again, he designed his own fiberglass main gear, and uses a Diehl nose wheel fork with a 4130 strut and 6\" wheel up front.\nEarly tests revealed cooling problems, which prompted a radiator move from the firewall to a lower cowling location.\nThe first flight was almost a disaster, as test pilot Randy Smith lost power right after takeoff. He managed a 180 with a safe downwind landing with only minor nosewheel pant damage. The culprit proved to be a spark plug with too much reach, which was quickly remedied. Subsequent flights have shown water temp to be about 210 degrees, oil temp is 220-230, and airspeed is about 180 mph.\nShopping for the Partially Built KR.\nThis story starts about twenty years ago when I first started looking at the KR-2 as the plane I'd like to build. The only problem at that time was a lack of money, lack of knowledge, and a lack of job stability. I liked the design, except for the low ground clearance of the retractable gear and that a KR was going to be a tight fit for me to fly.",
                "Second, understand that the dimensions called for in the plans put a twist in the sides that tends to work the panel in two directions of curvature. This twist makes the panel \"undevelopable\" meaning that that shape cannot be unrolled into an equivalent flat shape. This is important when laying out the side and bottom panels onto flat plywood. To illustrate this, try forming a piece of paper around a soda can. The paper can be formed flat around the can either straight or at a diagonal to it's length. It has only one direction of curvature and is by definition \"developable\". Now try to form the same piece of paper around a baseball. It won't lie flat on the surface without some deformation (folding, wrinkling or tearing) of the paper. The ball has curvature in more that one direction and is a \"compounded\" shape. Paper (or plywood) can only be readily formed in developable shapes as opposed to aluminum or other metal which can accept in plane deformation. A developable surface is needed to lay out a curved surface when the materials used can't be deformed with any degree of in-plane strain.\nInitially, the fuselage sides are laid out flat with reference to the top longeron measured to a straight chalk line. The bowing problem starts when the side panels are bent and sloped to form the fuselage box section. If the sides were not sloped (tumbled home), the section formed would be cylindrical and the longerons would lie flat. Since the sides are tumbled home, the section formed is now conical. When a conical shape is cut with a plane (building surface) not perpendicular to it's axis, the shape formed is elliptical -- exactly what happens with the top longeron. When it's built flat, bent to form a cylindrical section, and sloped to form a conical section, it takes on an elliptical shape firewall to tailstock.\nThis method borrows heavily from proven techniques used in the marine trades. It should be stressed at this point that although the layout procedure is not complicated, it is important to take your time. If the layout is not going well initially, start over! Better to erase layout errors now than to have them built it and cause surprises later.",
                "I also found a small linear crack in the lower left wing spar cap on the left wing stub. It appeared to be from over tightening the rear spar wing attach fitting bolts. His explanation was that the crack wasn't important because the rear spars only job is to keep the wings from folding back. I also noticed that the holes for attaching the outer wing to the wing stub were badly rounded out on the rear spar. He explained that the Diehl wing skins require the rear spar to be swept slightly more forward than the stock wings. This won't allow you to use the rear spar attach fittings from RR and that I would need to fabricate a new set of rear spar attach fittings.\nI also found that the aileron bellcranks were not built or installed as per plans, but found that they looked professional. I couldn't check for function since the right bellcrank and sheeve wasn't installed, the left wing also wasn't installed, and the right wing didn't exist yet.\nNext we pulled the inspection panels off of the fuselage and tail and looked at everything I could see with a good flashlight. I didn't find anything else that might be questionable about the fuselage except for a cracked elevator trim tab that was damaged when it fell off it's hanging place on the wall.\nNext we spent some time going over his builders log and builders photo album. I still hadn't seen anything that would dissuade me from buying this project.",
                "Probably one of the most frustrating things about building experimental aircraft, especially when starting with a minimum of pre-fabricated parts, is to start building and ending up with an unexpected result. Every builder starts a new project by wanting it to go \"perfectly.\" So when things aren't going well, especially at the beginning, the frustration can lead to an unfinished airplane.\nThis is the first article in a series dedicated to helping builders of the Rand Robinson KR series planes build a straight and true fuselage -- the first part of the construction process. Borrowing from modern boatbuliding techniques, focus will be on the KR-2S, but the principles apply to the entire lineup of KR-1 & KR-2 series planes.\nWhile building the KR-2(s) a common surprise is encountered by builders when the completed fuselage sides are laid into position to form the fuselage box section. With many hours spent building the sides flat, finding the once straight longerons that now bow up from the building surface, form a most dissatisfying \"banana\" shape. Especially when using the preformed fiberglass parts, this curve in the top longeron is not acceptable. The builder is left wondering what went wrong and no amount of clamping or brute force forming will solve the problem to any degree of satisfaction. The problem is not the builder's fault. The solution starts by understanding the three dimensional relationship of the assembled parts being built.\nFirst understand that the plans show the finished form of the plane. They show the \"projected\" form as you would expect to see it if viewing an actual plane from the top, ends and from the side. Since the sides are sloped (flared) outward, looking from the side, the distances given by measuring the profile drawing are \"foreshortened\" and don't give the proper shape for building the fuselage with a flat top longeron. What needs to be done is to \"develop\" the \"true\" distances and shape of the flat panel so that when it is curved into position, the longerons lay flat.",
                "They both wanted to build a fast, inexpensive airplane which was also economical to maintain. Several designs were considered, and plans were bought first for the Jeanie's Teenie and then the Taylor Monoplane. The Monoplane was more to their liking, but would require some modification to fit their needs. A cooperative redesign effort ensued, with virtually no dimensions left untouched. Only the basic fuselage structure, airfoil, and powerplant were retained. The tail shape was Stu's, and came directly from the big DC-8s parked on the ramp outside his office window. The landing gear was designed by Ken, after seeing the gear on a Dewey Bird at Santa Paula airport.\nKen was killed in his KR2 a short time later while flying over Cajon Pass in what was apparently a bad weather / low fuel accident. Ken's wife Jeanette became owner of RR overnight, and stepped up to keep the plans and parts coming. Much of the engineering needs are handled by Bill Marcy of Denver, who's been helping out since early '79.\nTo date, almost 6000 KR1, 9200 KR2, and 760 KR2S plan sets have been sold. 1200 KR2s are estimated to be flying, with 5 KR2Ss now in the air. Much of the development work done on KR's is now done by the builders themselves. KR builders tend to be innovative, which leads to some interesting modifications. Some of the mods that work eventually creep into the plans. The KR2S is a case in point. Many builders who'd heard of the pitch sensitivity and tight cabin of the KR2 began to build an enlarged version, with the length determined by the most commonly available longeron material. The result is a KR2 that is stretched 2\" between firewall and main spar, and 14\" behind the main spar. Higher gross weights dictated more wing area, with the new standard becoming the Diehl wing skin. Those who plan to carry passengers commonly stretch the cabin width a few inches, although 1.5 inches is the limit if you still want to use RR's premolded parts.\nMike Stearns addresses the KR Forum crowd.",
                "Layout to ensure a fair and true fuselage starts by drawing a reference line (baseline) on the building surface. Refer to figures 2 & 3 and use a wire guide to draw a very straight baseline. About 500 lbs. Of tension should be adequate. One could use a chalk line, but we're talking airplanes here, not house framing.\nThe main layout difference is that the baseline isn't used as a reference for the top longeron. The baseline references the mid point of the firewall for the developed (and true dimensioned) side panel. Although the baseline will still be the reference, the top and bottom longerons will be laid separately.\nLayout differences don't end there. Each of the stations (vertical members) will be laid out with a calculated separation so that when the panels are formed into position, they land on the spacing called for in the plans. Another major difference is that the bottom & side panels are applied after forming the fuselage box section. This is mainly to obtain the ability to \"fair\" the side and bottom surfaces and insure a straight and true shape.\nRefer to figure 1 for the layout of the new developed side panel. The firewall (station a) is layed out perpendicular to the baseline. Longitudinal (station) measurements are given along the length of the baseline from the firewall. Vertical dimensions are given to reference the angle and breadths of the station at the baseline.\nNotice that the top longeron is bowed outward and that the stations are spaced slightly greater than called out in the plans. When the panels are formed into the box frame section ,they will work into the dimensions specified in the plans.\nStrike a centerline, longer than is needed on the building surface using a wire guide. Draw off the firewall line perpendicular to the centerline at one end.\nUsing the distances listed in the balloons, mark them off on the centerline. Distances are measured to the nearest sixteenth of an inch. Take time to mark them off carefully. Don't mark off the distances in a cumulative fashion. Use the firewall as a common reference.\nUsing the angles listed at each station, mark off a station line longer than is needed. The angles are measured to the nearest hundredth of a degree. Take time to mark them off carefully.",
                "After the bulkheads were bondoed to the fuselage I used the stringers that I ripped from the 1x4s and bondoed them to the bulkheads. This gave me a male form to cover with thin plastic or posterboard. I stapled two layers of posterboard to the jig(thin plastic would work better). The posterboard wraps down two inches onto the fuselage. After I was satisfied with the way it looked, I then covered the entire thing with duct tape (fiberglass will not stick to duct tape) On top of this I wetout one layer of tri-ply cloth (22oz) that I had left over from an earlier project, and one layer of 8oz. bid. Remember to mask off your fuselage so you don't get epoxy on it. If you are not familiar with composite lay-ups, you should plan on razor cutting your lay-ups 4 to 6 hours after wetout while the lay-up is still soft enough to cut with a razorblade.\nAfter the lay-up cured (2 or 3 days) it was removed from the jig, and the jig was removed from the fuselage and discarded. (be careful, the bondo sticks very well to the spruce, you could splinter your wood during removal) I now have a fiberglass skin that tends to hold the shape of the jig but is still flexible enough to work with. I made two bulkheads out of 1/4 last-a-foam (AS&S) using the plywood formers from the jig as a guide. I covered these foam bulkheads with one 8oz layer of glass on each side, with a glass to glass edge on the bottom. After cure these bulkheads were bondoed into place (to the fuselage)and the fiberglass skin was pulled down tight and floxed to the bulkheads. When the flox cured the bondo joints were broken, again being careful not to harm the wood. The turtledeck was removed from the fuselage and 2 inch tapes added to the bulkheads inside and out."

The lay-up was cut with a razorblade while still soft, and after curing for 2-3 days, the jig was removed from the fuselage. Foam bulkheads were created using the jig's plywood formers as a guide, covered with glass on both sides, and bondoed into place. The fiberglass skin was pulled tight and floxed to the bulkheads, and after curing, the bondo joints were broken without damaging the wood. Finally, 2-inch tapes were added to the bulkheads inside and out."

                        "This article is the first in a series aimed at helping builders of Rand Robinson KR series planes construct a straight and true fuselage. It focuses on the KR-2S but applies to the entire KR-1 & KR-2 lineup. A common issue builders face is the \"banana\" shape that occurs when the fuselage sides are assembled, despite the longerons being built flat. This happens because the plans show the finished form of the plane, which doesn't account for the sloped sides that cause foreshortening. The solution involves developing the true distances and shape of the flat panel to ensure the longerons lay flat when curved into position.",
                        "The text discusses the importance of understanding the curvature of panels in aircraft construction, particularly when dealing with \"undevelopable\" shapes that cannot be flattened without deformation. It explains that plywood, like paper, can only be easily formed into \"developable\" shapes with a single direction of curvature, unlike metals that can handle in-plane deformation. The example of forming paper around a soda can versus a baseball illustrates this concept. The text then describes the process of laying out fuselage sides, emphasizing the need to account for the sloped sides (tumbled home) that create a conical shape, resulting in an elliptical top longeron. The method is rooted in marine construction techniques and stresses the importance of careful, accurate layout to avoid errors that could cause issues later in the build process.",

Secure keeper blocks between stations to maintain shape, avoiding interference with future diagonal members. Measure and position vertical and diagonal members, and outline them on the building surface. Finish side panels similarly to the handbook, attaching skin panels later. Future articles will discuss jigging techniques, building a strongback jig, and assembly of side panels with joint details for a stronger fuselage. Full-scale layout drawings are available for purchase.",
                        "\"Scarfing\" is a technique used in aircraft construction to splice short pieces of plywood to span long distances, required on fuselage skins and spar webs. The splice angle should be 10 to 12 degrees for strength and should align with structural members. A scarfer can be made by attaching a plunge router to a table saw, set at a 5.5 or 6.5 degree angle, using a 1 x 6 board and a 2-3 inch straight cutting bit. Ken Rand and Stuart Robinson, former flight system engineers for Douglas Avionics, were responsible for final system corrections on DC-8, 9, and 10 aircraft deliveries.",

Tragically, Ken died in a KR2 crash, leaving his wife Jeanette to manage their company, Rans Designs. With help from Bill Marcy, they have sold nearly 16,000 plan sets for the KR1, KR2, and KR2S models. Over 1,200 KR2s and 5 KR2Ss are currently flying, with builders contributing to ongoing development. The KR2S, for example, evolved from builders' modifications to address pitch sensitivity and cabin space issues in the KR2.",

The engine is equipped with a Holley carburetor, a PSRU with a 1.69:1 reduction ratio, and is air-conditioned. Originally a taildragger, it now has tricycle gear with custom aluminum wheels and Cleveland calipers. Cooling issues led to a radiator relocation, and an early flight mishap was caused by a spark plug issue. The aircraft now performs well, with temperatures and speeds within acceptable ranges. The builder's journey began 20 years ago with a desire to build a KR-2, overcoming financial and knowledge barriers."

                        "The inspection revealed a small linear crack in the lower left wing spar cap, likely caused by overtightening the rear spar wing attach fitting bolts. The builder explained that the crack was not critical as the rear spars primarily prevent the wings from folding back. Additionally, the holes for attaching the outer wing to the wing stub were rounded out on the rear spar, requiring new rear spar attach fittings due to the Diehl wing skins' design. The aileron bellcranks were not built or installed as per plans but appeared professionally done, though functionality could not be assessed due to incomplete assembly. The fuselage inspection found a cracked elevator trim tab, damaged when it fell off the wall.

Believing they could fix any major problems themselves, they negotiated a price, bought the project, and transported it home. However, they later discovered several issues they had missed during the initial inspection, attributing some to ignorance and others to insufficient scrutiny.

Additionally, the aileron bellcranks were installed in front of the rear spar, requiring further modifications. On the right side, the aileron bellcrank setup was found to be non-functional due to cable tension issues and interference with the wing attach fittings. These problems necessitated either a complete redesign or removal and rebuilding of the rear spar and aileron system, highlighting the severity of the issues encountered.",

They decided to wrap the trailing edge of both wings with additional glass. Upon inspecting a damaged trim tab, they found the hinge was only attached to the foam and not the glass, so they wrapped the front of the tab with glass as well.

Beary in April 1950. Goodwin was detached from that assignment two months and appointed member of the General Board of the Navy. He was shortly thereafter appointed acting Navy Chief of Public Information, as the substitute for Rear Admiral Russell S. Berkey, who was relieved of illness, but returned to the General Board of the Navy in July that year. Goodwin served in that capacity until February 1951, when he relieved his Academy class, Rear admiral John P. Whitney as Vice Commander, Military Air Transport Service (MATS).\n\nWhile in this capacity, Goodwin served under Lieutenant general Laurence S. Kuter and was co-responsible for the logistical support of United Nations troops fighting in Korea. The MATS operated from the United States to Japan and Goodwin served in this capacity until August 1953, when he was appointed Commander Carrier Division Two. While in this assignment, he took part in the Operation Mariner, Joint Anglo-American exercise which encountered very heavy seas over a two-week period in fall 1953.\n\nGoodwin was ordered to the Philippines in May 1954 and assumed duty as Commander, U.S. Naval Forces in the Philippines with headquarters at Naval Station Sangley Point near Cavite. He held that command in the period of tensions between Taiwan and China and publicly declared shortly after his arrival, that any attack on Taiwan by the Chinese Communists on the mainland would result in US participation in the conflict. The naval fighter planes under his command also provided escort for passing commercial planes. Goodwin worked together with retired Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, then-Ambassador to the Philippines, and accompanied him during the visits to Singapore, Bangkok and Saigon in January 1955.\n\nOn December 18, 1955, Goodwin's classmate Rear admiral Albert K. Morehouse, then serving as Commander, Naval Air Forces, Continental Air Defense Command (CONAD), died of heart attack and Goodwin was ordered to CONAD headquarters in Colorado Springs, Colorado to assume Morehouse's position. While in this capacity, he was subordinated to Army General Earle E. Partridge and was responsible for the Naval and Marine Forces allocated to the command designated for the defense of the Continental United States.\n\nRetirement",
                "Goodwin retired on June 1, 1957, after 40 years of active service and was advanced to the rank of Vice admiral on the retired list for having been specially commended in combat. A week later, he was invited back to his Monroe High School (now Neville High School) and handed a diploma showing that he had been graduated with the class of 1918. He then settled in Monterey, California where he taught American history at Stevenson school and was a member of the Naval Order of the United States.\n\nVice admiral Hugh H. Goodwin died at his home on February 25, 1980, aged 79. He was survived by his wife, Eleanor with whom he had two children, a daughter Sidney and a son Hugh Jr., who graduated from the Naval Academy in June 1948, but died one year later, when the Hellcat fighter he was piloting collided with another over the Gulf of Mexico during training.\n\nDecorations\n\nHere is the ribbon bar of Vice admiral Hugh H.

On the 17th, her combat air patrol (CAP) shot down or turned back all but a handful of 47 enemy planes headed for her task group and her gunners shot down two of the three planes that did break through to attack her.\n\nGoodwin's carrier continued in providing of close ground support operations at Tinian during the end of July 1944, then turned her attention to Guam, where she gave identical aid to invading troops until mid-August that year. For his service during the Mariana Islands campaign, Goodwin was decorated with Bronze Star Medal with Combat \"V\".\n\nHe was succeeded by Captain Walter V. R. Vieweg on August 18, 1944, and appointed Chief of Staff, Carrier Division Six under Rear admiral Arthur W. Radford. The Gambier Bay was sunk in the Battle off Samar on October 25, 1944, during the Battle of Leyte Gulf after helping turn back a much larger attacking Japanese surface force.\n\nGoodwin served with Carrier Division Six during the Bonin Islands raids, the naval operations at Palau and took part in the Battle of Leyte Gulf and operations supporting Leyte landings in late 1944. He was later appointed Air Officer of the Philippine Sea Frontier under Rear admiral James L. Kauffman and remained with that command until the end of hostilities.

Johnson launched the wave of discontent between senior commanders in the United States Navy. Johnson proposed the merging of the Marine Corps into the Army, and reduce the Navy to a convoy-escort force.\n\nGoodwin's superior officer, Admiral Blandy was call to testify before the House Committee on Armed Services and his harsh statements for the defense of the Navy, costed him his career. Goodwin shared his views and openly criticized Secretary Johnson for having power concentrated in a single civilian executive, who is an appointee of the Government and not an elected representative of the people. He also criticized aspects of defense unification which permitted the Joint Chiefs of Staff to vote on arms policies of individual services, and thus \"rob\" the branches of autonomy.\n\nThe outbreak of the Korean War in summer 1950 proved the proposal of Secretary Johnson as incorrect and he resigned in September that year.

                "Legal career\nImmediately after law school Born was selected as a law clerk to judge Henry Edgerton of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. It was during this time that she met her first husband, Jacob C. Landau, who was a journalist covering the Federal courts at the time. Following her clerkship, she became an associate at the Washington, D.C.-based international law firm of Arnold & Porter. Born was attracted to Arnold & Porter because it was one of the few major law firms to have a woman partner at that time, Carolyn Agger, who was the head of the tax practice. Born took a two-year leave of absence from Arnold & Porter to accompany her first husband to Boston, where he had received a fellowship. During that time she worked as a research assistant to law professor Alan Dershowitz.\n\nBorn's early career at Arnold & Porter focused on international trade law, in which she represented a number of Swiss industries and the government of Switzerland. She developed a practice representing clients in numerous complex litigation and arbitration cases involving financial market transactions. Among her high-profile cases was the matter of the Hunt Brothers attempt to corner the market in silver in the 1970s. She made partner at Arnold & Porter, after moving to a three-day schedule to help raise her second child, and eventually rose to be the head of the firm's derivatives practice.\n\nBorn was among the first female attorneys to systematically address inequities regarding how the laws treated women. Born and another female lawyer, Marna Tucker, taught what is considered to have been the first \"Women and the Law\" course at Catholic University\u2019s Columbus School of Law. The class exclusively concerned prejudicial treatment of women under the laws of the United States, past and present.  Born and Tucker were surprised to discover that there was no textbook on the issue at the time.  Born is also one of the co-founders of the National Women's Law Center. Born also helped rewrite the American Bar Association rules to make it possible for more women and minorities to sit on federal bench.",
                "In 1998, a trillion-dollar hedge fund called Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) was near collapse.  Using mathematical models to calculate debt risk, LTCM used derivatives to leverage $5 billion into more than $1 trillion, doing business with fifteen of Wall Street's largest financial institutions.  The derivative transactions were not regulated, nor were investors able to evaluate LTCM's exposures.  Born stated, \"I thought that LTCM was exactly what I had been worried about\".  In the last weekend of September 1998, the President's working group was told that the entire American economy hung in the balance.  After intervention by the Federal Reserve, the crisis was averted.  In congressional hearings into the crisis, Greenspan acknowledged that language had been introduced into an agriculture bill that would prevent CFTC from regulating the derivatives which were at the center of the crisis that threatened the US economy.  U.S. Representative Maurice Hinchey (D-NY) asked \"How many more failures do you think we'd have to have before some regulation in this area might be appropriate?\"  In response, Greenspan brushed aside the substance of Born's warnings with the simple assertion that \"the degree of supervision of regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market is quite adequate to maintain a degree of stability in the system\". Born's warning was that there wasn't any regulation of them.  Born's chief of staff, Michael Greenberger summed up Greenspan's position this way: \"Greenspan didn't believe that fraud was something that needed to be enforced, and he assumed she probably did. And of course, she did.\"  Under heavy pressure from the financial lobby, legislation prohibiting regulation of derivatives by Born's agency was passed by the Congress.  Born resigned on June 1, 1999.\n\nThe derivatives market continued to grow yearly throughout both terms of George W. Bush's administration. On September 15, 2008, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers forced a broad recognition of a financial crisis in both the US and world capital markets.  As Lehman Brothers' failure temporarily reduced financial capital's confidence, a number of newspaper articles and television programs suggested that the failure's possible causes included the conflict between the CFTC and the other regulators.Faiola, Anthony, Nakashima, Ellen and Drew, Jill. The Crash: Risk and Regulation - What Went Wrong, The Washington Post, October 15, 2008.",
                "Born and the OTC derivatives market\nBorn was appointed to the CFTC on April 15, 1994, by President Bill Clinton. Due to litigation against Bankers Trust Company by Procter and Gamble and other corporate clients, Born and her team at the CFTC sought comments on the regulation of over-the-counter derivatives, a first step in the process of writing CFTC regulations to supplement the existing regulations of the Federal Reserve System,  the Options Clearing Corporation, and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Born was particularly concerned about swaps, financial instruments that are traded over the counter between banks, insurance companies or other funds or companies, and thus have no transparency except to the two counterparties and the counterparties' regulators, if any.  CFTC regulation was strenuously opposed by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, and by Treasury Secretaries Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers. On May 7, 1998, former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt joined Rubin and Greenspan in objecting to the issuance of the CFTC's concept release. Their response dismissed Born's analysis and focused on the hypothetical possibility that CFTC regulation of swaps and other OTC derivative instruments could create a \"legal uncertainty\" regarding such financial instruments,  hypothetically reducing the value of the instruments. They argued that the imposition of regulatory costs would \"stifle financial innovation\" and encourage financial capital to transfer its  transactions offshore. The disagreement between Born and the Executive Office's top economic policy advisors has been described not only as a classic Washington turf war, but also a war of ideologies,  insofar as it is possible to argue that Born's actions were consistent with Keynesian and neoclassical economics while Greenspan, Rubin, Levitt, and Summers consistently espoused neoliberal, and neoconservative policies.",

She has five adult children - two from a previous marriage to Jacob Landau and three stepchildren.

                "Born declined to publicly comment on the unfolding 2008 crisis until March 2009, when she said: \"The market grew so enormously, with so little oversight and regulation, that it made the financial crisis much deeper and more pervasive than it otherwise would have been.\" She also lamented the influence of Wall Street lobbyists on the process and the refusal of regulators to discuss even modest reforms.\n\nAn October 2009 Frontline documentary titled \"The Warning\"  described Born's thwarted efforts to regulate and bring transparency to the derivatives market, and the continuing opposition thereto. The program concluded with an excerpted interview with Born sounding another warning: \"I think we will have continuing danger from these markets and that we will have repeats of the financial crisis -- may differ in details but there will be significant financial downturns and disasters attributed to this regulatory gap, over and over, until we learn from experience.\"\n\nIn 2009 Born, along with Sheila Bair of the FDIC, was awarded the John F. Kennedy Profiles in Courage Award in recognition of the \"political courage she demonstrated in sounding early warnings about conditions that contributed\" to the 2007-08 financial crisis.  According to Caroline Kennedy, \"Brooksley Born recognized that the financial security of all Americans was being put at risk by the greed, negligence and opposition of  powerful and well connected interests.... The catastrophic financial events of recent months have  proved them [Born and Sheila Bair] right.\"  One member of the President's working group had a change of heart about Brooksley Born.  SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt stated \"I've come to know her as one of the most capable, dedicated, intelligent and committed public servants that I have ever come to know\", adding that \"I could have done much better. I could have made a difference\" in response to her warnings.\n\nIn 2010, a documentary film Inside Job further alleged that derivatives regulation was ineffective from the Clinton administration on. Along with fellow whistleblower, former IMF Chief Economist Raghuram Rajan, who was also scorned by the economic establishment, Brooksley Born was cited as one of the authorities arguing that financial derivatives increase economic risk.",

During her tenure on the CFTC, Born lobbied Congress and the President to give the CFTC oversight of off-exchange markets for derivatives, in addition to its role with respect to exchange-traded derivatives, but her warnings were ignored or dismissed, and her calls for reform resisted by other regulators.<ref name=\"nytimes\">Goodman, Peter S. The Reckoning - Taking Hard New Look at a Greenspan Legacy, The New York Times, October 9, 2008.</ref> Born resigned as chairperson on June 1, 1999, shortly after Congress passed legislation prohibiting her agency from regulating derivatives.\n\nIn 2009, Born received the John F. Kennedy Profiles in Courage Award, along with Sheila Bair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, in recognition of the \"political courage she demonstrated in sounding early warnings about conditions that contributed\" to the 2007-08 financial crisis.\n\nEarly life and education\nBorn graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School (San Francisco, California) at the age of 16. She then attended Stanford University, where she majored in English and was graduated with the class of 1961.  She initially wanted to become a doctor, but a guidance counsellor at Stanford advised her against medicine, so she majored in English literature instead.\n\nShe then attended Stanford Law School, one of only seven women in her class.  She was the first female student ever to be named president of the Stanford Law Review. She received the \"Outstanding Senior\" award and graduated as valedictorian of the class of 1964.",
                "During her long legal career, and into her retirement, Born did much pro bono and other types of volunteer work. She was active in the American Bar Association, the largest professional organization of lawyers in the United States.  Initially Born was named a member of the governing council of the ABA's Individual Rights Section, eventually becoming chairperson.  Born and Tucker founded the ABA Women's Caucus, the first organization of female lawyers in the ABA.  She held several other senior positions in the ABA, including being named the first woman member of the ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary.  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, Born provided testimony and opinion on persons nominated for federal judgeships. In 1980 she was named chair of the committee.  As chair of the committee, Born was invited to address the U.S. Congress regarding the nomination of Judge Sandra Day O'Connor to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nIn 1993, Born's name was floated as a possible candidate for Attorney General of the United States, but Janet Reno was nominated.\n\nIn July 2009, Nancy Pelosi appointed Brooksley Born as a commissioner to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC)."

To make Hajj Badal from... \"\nThis question was not yet completed when the Wahabi Maulvi fell at the feet of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) and said, \"Hazrat! It is enough. The problem has been solved. Today I have realised that Huzoor (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) has Ilme Ghaib. If not by now the Munaafiqeen would have destroyed the Islamic Missions. If Almighty Allah has shown you those things about me which nobody else here knows about, then I cannot imagine all that which He has informed Rasoolullah (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) of\".\nThe Wahabi Maulvi immediately repented and became Mureed of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu).\nEach year, Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) used to go to Calcutta for missionary work. The Pope used to also visit Calcutta and although he received good coverage in the media, very few Christians turned up to meet the Pope. The Christians of Calcutta became very jealous whenever Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) visited that city as, without any news coverage, he attracted thousands of people who came to see him.",

The Government of Pakistan then accepted the Fatawa of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) and the Hilaal Committee of Pakistan was disbanded.\nMufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) wrote more or less 50 000 Fatawas in his lifetime. His word was accepted by great Ulema.

No person in his presence could say or do anything against Shariah. No person could speak against that which was the truth. It is stated by one of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu's) Khaadim's, who accompanied him on a journey by train, that there were some people in the train who were consuming alcohol. When Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) saw them, he reprimanded them and told them to desist from such a Haraam act. They did not listen to his advise so he scolded the leader of the group who was a young and well-built person. He gave the young person a hard slap which caused the bottle of alcohol to fall far from his hand. The Khaadim expected the person to retaliate but, who had the nerve to retaliate against this Lion of Islam! They became afraid and sat down quietly. Later some of them came up to Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) and begged for forgiveness for their shameful behavior.\n\"Tassawuf, Philsafa, Tafseer ki fiqhi Masa'il, Subhi kahte hai ke Aqida Kusha he Mufti Azam\"\nMufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu), who after writing his first Fatawa while still a student at \"Darul Uloom Manzare Islam\", was given the status of Mufti due to his immense knowledge. When the Muslim World began to see his knowledge and Fatawas brightenening the world, they began calling him \"Mufti-e-Azam\" or The Most Exalted Mufti of the Time. This title alone became the name he was recognised by. Whenever the name \"Mufti Azam Hind\" was mentioned, it referred to none other than his exalted personality.",

The respect which he showed towards them is beyond explanation.\nOne day, in 1979, a lady came with her little child to ask for Ta'weez. It was a very hot day and she was informed that Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was resting. The lady, however, was in great need for the particular Ta'weez. She asked someone to see if Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was awake but nobody had the nerve of going near him while he was resting as they considered this to be disrespectful. Taking her child she commented, \"What did we know that the words of Sayeds will not be heard in this place\".\nIt is not known how Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) heard this, but he immediately summoned one of the Mureeds. He instructed him to call the lady and not give her grief. The woman then sent her child to Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu). He asked the child's name and showed great love and respect towards this young child. With great affection, he placed his hand on the child's head. He even asked someone to bring an apple for the child. From behind the curtain, he spoke to the lady concerning her problem and immediately wrote a Ta'weez for her.\nMufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) then sent a message to his family requesting that the mother and child should only be allowed to leave after the heat became less intense; that they should be well entertained and that no shortage should be spared in entertaining these Sayeds.",

He never refused the invitation of any poor Muslim. He always stayed away from those who were very wealthy and lavish. He was the possessor of great moral and ethical values.\nIt is stated that once Akbar Ali Khan, a Governor of U.P., came to visit Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu). Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) did not meet him but left to a place called Puraana Shahar (Old City) to visit a poor Sunni Muslim who was very ill and at the doorstep of death.\nIn another occasion, Fakhruddeen Ali Ahmad, the President of a Political Party, came to visit Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) but was refused this opportunity. Many other proud ministers had also come to meet Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) but met with the same fate.

On hearing this he became silent.\nOn the 13th of Muharram, he again asked concerning the date and the Mureedeen present said that it was Wednesday, the 13th of Muharram. On hearing this Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) said, \"Namaaz will be held at Nau Mahla Musjid\". Those present did not understand what he meant, but remained silent out of respect. After some time again Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) said, \"Did anybody tell you about the Namaaz. I will read Jumma Namaaz in Nau Mahla Masjid.\" After some time Hazrat said, \"Did anybody say anything about the Fatiha.\" Those present just gazed at each others faces and remained silent. Only later did they realise what Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was implying. Hazrat was spiritally present for Jummah at the Nau Mahla Masjid! Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was not only giving hope to the Mureedeen but also informing them of his Wisaal.",

When he was physically fit he used go into the Visitors Section and ask each person whether they had eaten or not. He used to ask them if they partook in tea or not. He used to continuously enquire as to whether they were experiencing any difficulties or not. It was often seen that he would personally carry the dishes into the house for the visitors! He was definitely blessed with the characters of the \"Salfe Saliheen\" or The Pious Servants of Allah.\nMufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) was a pillar of hospitality and humbleness. If he reprimanded a certain person for doing something un-Islamic or if he became displeased with anyone for some reason or the other, he used to also explain to the person in a very nice way and also try to cheer that person. He would then make Dua in abundance for such a person. His Mureeds (Disciples), on many ocassions, used to recite Manqabats (Poetry) in his praise. On hearing such Manqabats he would say, \"I am not worthy of such praise. May Allah make me worthy.\"\nMany people came to him for his blessings. Others would come for Ta'weez. He never refused anyone. It is also not known how many homes were being supported through the kindness and hospitality of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu). He always entertained those who came from far and near to the best of his means. He used to even give most of his visitors train and bus fares to travel. In winter, he would give warm clothes, warm sheets and blankets to the poor and the needy.",
                "During the reign of General Ayub Khan a \"Rooyat Hilal Committee\" was formed in Pakistan for the purpose of sighting the moon for every Islamic Month, and more importantly, for Eid-ul-Fitr and Eid-ul-Adha. An aeroplane was flown up to a certain height and the moon would be sighted from there. This form of Shahaadah (Confirmation) of the sighting of the moon via an aeroplane was readily accepted by the Pakistani Government. In this manner, Eid was celebrated.\nOn a specific occasion, on the 29th of Ramadaan, an aero plane was flown from the East to the West of Pakistan and the moon was reported to be sighted. This sighting was announced by the Hilaal Committee, but the Sunni Ulema of Pakistan did not accept this confirmation. The Ulema of Pakistan sent questionnaires to the Ulema throughout the world for clarification and one such questionnaire was sent to Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu). Many Ulema replied that the confirmation had to be accepted and that it was permissible, but Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) clearly replied that this was not permissible. His Fatawa read as follows:\" The Command of Shariah is to sight the Moon and fast or celebrate Eid. Where the Moon is not sighted the Qazi should give an Islamic decision in connection with a confirmation. The moon must be sighted from the ground level or any place attached to the ground. With regards to the matter of using the plane - to sight the moon via a plane is wrong because the moon sets and does not perish. This is why it is sometimes sighted on the 29th and sometimes on the 30th. If to fly in a plane to sight the moon is a condition, then by increasing altitude the moon will be sighted even on the 27th and 28th. In this case, will the sighting be confirmed for the 27th or 28th? No person in his right sense will accept this. Thus under these circumstances, how would it be proper to sight the moon on the 29th?\"",
                "Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) always commanded Muslims to give or take anything with their right hand. He stopped the Muslims from calling the governments as their \"Sarkaar\" or leaders. He never kept any ordinary Kitaab on the books of Tafseer or Hadith. Whenever he sat in a Meelad-un-Nabi (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) or Mehfil-e-Zikr, he always sat with utmost respect until the very end.\nMufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) never spat towards the Qibla. He never stretched his legs in the direction of the Qibla. Whenever he entered the cemetery, he never used his entire feet to walk on the ground. He always walked on his toes. At times, he would stand on his toes for about half an hour in the graveyard making Dua-e- Maghfirat!\nHe always stopped Muslims from doing any false fortune telling. If any death or loss took place in the house of a Muslim, Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) would go to comfort the people of that house but he would never eat there. He always advised those in sorrow to make Sabr and remember Almighty Allah. He always respected Ulema-e-Ikraam. He respected the Sayeds in such a manner as a slave will respect his King. He prohibited Muslims from keeping un-Islamic names. He preferred such names as Abdullah, Abdur Rahmaan, Muhammad and Ahmad.",

Mufti-e-Azam-e- Hind (radi Allahu anhu) said that the sky and the earth are both stationary and that the moon and the sun are in motion. On hearing this Allama Ghulam Jilani Mirati (radi Allahu anhu) said, \"In the Holy Quran it is said, 'Wash Shamsu Tajri Li Mustaqaril'laha'. In other words, the sun is in motion in its fixed abode. From the word 'Tajri', it is obvious that the sun is in motion and from the word 'Mustaqaril'laha' it is obvious that it is stationary in one place. How can both these concepts be right?\"\nIn answer to this, Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) immediately said, \"It was commanded to Hazrat Adam (alaihis salaam) and Hazrat Hawa (radi Allahu anha) (as follows): 'Walakum fil Ardi Mustaqar'. Does this mean that they were stationary in only one portion of the earth? Did they not walk around (on the earth)? To be Mustaqar means to be stationary in your surrounding, not to come out of your boundaries. To move but to move within your boundaries of movement.\" On hearing this Allama Mirati Sahib (radi Allahu anhu) became silent.",

Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) used to show his displeasure towards those who wore ties.

Most of his poems were in the form of Humd (Praise of Allah), Naath Shareef, Qasidas and Manqabats compiled in the Arabic, Urdu, Persian and Hindi languages. All these poems were compiled into a book which is famously known as \"Samaane Bakhshish\" which is still available toady. Samaane Bakhshsish is a treasure chest which flows with pearls of love for Sayyiduna Rasoolullah (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam).

He was taking \"Fatawa Razvia\" from the shelf as his reference. On seeing this, Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) said, \"Are you relying on Fatawa Razvia to write an answer?\" Maulana Zafrud'deen (radi Allahu anhu) replied, \"Alright then, why don't you write the answer without looking.\" Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) then wrote a powerful answer without any problem. This was the Fatawa concerning \"Raza'at\" - the very first Fatawa which he had written.\nSayyiduna A'la Hazrat (radi Allahu anhu) then signed the Fatawa. He also commanded Hafiz Yaqeenudeen (radi Allahu anhu) to make a stamp for Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) as a gift and said that it should read as follows: \"Abul Barkaat Muhiy'yuddeen Jilani Aale Rahmaan urf Mustapha Raza Khan.\"\nThis incident took place in 1328 AH.

Hazrat Qari Maslihud'deen (radi Allahu anhu) further highlights that after the passing of his mentor, his primary focus and that of the entire Sunni population was on the personality of Mufti Azam Hind (radi Allahu anhu). The text also underscores the importance for a Mo'min (believer) to remain steadfast on the Shariat and Sunnat of Prophet Muhammad (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam), prepared to face life's difficulties and calamities with gratitude to Allah."

A Wahabi Maulvi argued with Hazrat about the Ilme Ghaib (Knowledge of the Unseen) of Prophet Muhammad (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). Despite Ashfaaq's advice, Hazrat allowed the Maulvi to speak, emphasizing the importance of listening. The Maulvi spent about 45 minutes trying to prove that the Prophet did not possess Ilme Ghaib. Hazrat then challenged the Maulvi's beliefs, urging him to repent and listen to Hazrat's counter-arguments. Hazrat asked a question about a son's responsibility towards his widowed mother, which the Maulvi refused to answer, deeming it irrelevant. Hazrat concluded by stating that he didn't mind the questioning but emphasized the need for listening.",

They intended to claim that Hazrat was lying when he asked them to say they had given their hand into the hands of Ghous-e-Azam (radi Allahu anhu). Two of the Christians became fearful upon seeing Hazrat's noorani face, but the third, more stubborn one, proceeded with the plan. When Hazrat instructed him to say he had given his hand to Ghous-e-Azam, the Christian instead said he was giving his hand to Mufti-e-Azam, implying that Hazrat was asking him to lie. Despite being commanded again, the Christian repeated the same response.",

The Christian repeatedly affirmed this, claiming to have seen bright hands from Hazrat's hands, believed to be Ghous-e-Azam's. After seeking forgiveness and revealing his true intentions, the Christian converted to Islam and became a Mureed. This miraculous event led to thousands of Christians accepting Islam.

The 26-year-old collected prescriptions for 390 pills and overdosed two days later. Brian Moore traveled 13 hours from his Laurel County, Ky., home to see Averill. He left with prescriptions for 600 pills and also overdosed within 48 hours.\nKenneth Hammond didn\u2019t make it back to his Knoxville, Tenn., home. He had a seizure after picking up prescriptions for 540 pills and died in an Ocala gas station parking lot.\nKeith Konkol didn\u2019t make it back to Tennessee, either. His body was dumped on the side of a remote South Carolina road after he overdosed in the back seat of a car the same day of his clinic visit. He had collected eight prescriptions totaling 720 doses of oxycodone, methadone, Soma and Xanax. Konkol had every reason to believe he would get those prescriptions: In three previous visits to the Plantation clinic, he had picked up prescriptions for 1,890 pills.\nAn estimated 60 percent of her patients were from out of state, a former medical assistant told the DEA. In 2015, Averill pleaded not guilty to eight manslaughter charges. She is awaiting trial in Broward County. Averill was just one doctor at just one clinic. In 2010, the year Averill\u2019s patients overdosed, Florida received applications to open 1,026 more pain clinics.\nAn online message board advising drug users summed it up: \u201cJust go anywhere in South Florida and look for a \u2018pain management clinic.\u2019 It shouldn\u2019t be too hard; you can\u2019t swing a dead cat without hitting one.\u201d Complain about anything from a back injury to a hangnail, it advised, \u201cand they\u2019ll set you right up.\u201d\nBy this time, Kentucky had reined in its pill mills. It didn\u2019t matter, Ohio, Delaware, North Carolina, Connecticut acted as well, but other state\u2019s efforts didn\u2019t matter either, Florida continued ignoring the pill mills and rogue doctors feeding the nation\u2019s oxycodone habit, the pills flowed.",

It\u2019s where he enrolled at Marshall University. It\u2019s where he first tried OxyContin. By the time Lockwood entered Marshall, Detroit dealers were trickling into Huntington, selling OxyContin and pills with OxyContin\u2019s active ingredient, oxycodone.\nEven though Lockwood could step out his front door and get the drug, Detroit street dealers weren\u2019t the preferred supplier, they were in Florida.\nIt may have been 1,000 miles away, but to Lockwood, getting OxyContin and oxycodone from Florida\u2019s loosely regulated pain clinics \u201cwas legal, in a sense.\u201d\nTwice a month, different \u201ccrews\u201d from Huntington crowded into vans and headed south to Palm Beach and Broward counties, home to more than 200 pill mills, the pain clinics where anyone with a fake ache and hard cash could walk out with pills and prescriptions.\nAfter hitting a string of clinics, the Huntington crews drove back with \u201caround 500 to 600 pills per person,\u201d said Lockwood.",
                "The East Kentucky hills and valleys of Greenup County suit Keith Cooper, a long-haired undercover cop-turned-sheriff: \u201cIt\u2019s a backwater. I tell people all the time I am a hick sheriff from a hick location, and by 2011, the rural county and its sheriff had big city problems.\nGreenup is near the stretch of interstate highways that provided drug traffickers and users with a straight shot to Palm Beach and Broward pill mills. It\u2019s less than an hour\u2019s ride to Huntington Tri-State Airport, where a $27 flight to Fort Lauderdale was a popular draw for dealers hoping to stock up.\nArrests for Florida pills soon eclipsed local arrests for pot.\n\u201cWhen we locked \u2019em up, we take all their pill bottles and all their paperwork, and we found maps to the doctors offices and everything,\u201d recalled Cooper.\n\u201cI called the (Florida) medical board and gave them a big list of doctors,\u201d Cooper said. He called the state pharmacy board, too. He got no response.\n\u201cSo then I called the Attorney General\u2019s Office and the Governor\u2019s Office. I was calling them all, the whole state. Of course, I was talking to the state police the entire time. \u201cI told them, all of the profits were down there. And all of the pain\u2019s up here.\u201d Nothing happened. Florida\u2019s oxycodone pipeline continued to flow.\nOn the other side of the law in Greenup, Mikey Frazier was banking on it.\nThe Oxy Express\nFrazier was on a scholarship to play baseball at his junior college in Chicago when he suffered a torn rotator cuff. Doctors prescribed Percocet, a pill containing oxycodone, in 2002. When doctors cut him off, he bought it on the street. In 2006, he moved to OxyContin, nearly pure oxycodone. In 2007, he gave his friends money to go to Florida and bring him back pills.",
                "Rubio didn\u2019t kill the 2002 bill out of opposition to prescription monitoring\u2014it was politics \u201cas usual\u201d yet nobody blamed Rubio for the resulting opioid crisis that seems to have started in his political backyard and flourished beyond belief..\nU.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., was a leader in the Florida House in 2002 when he blocked a vote on prescription monitoring. That year, Rubio favored a bill changing the Miami-Dade County charter, which failed to pass because of a single \u201cno\u201d vote in the Senate. Burt cast the vote.\nAngered by what he saw as Burt\u2019s betrayal, Rubio killed the prescription drug monitoring bill. \u201cWhen I found out he broke his word, it made the choice easy,\u201d Rubio told The Miami Herald.\nIt\u2019s not certain that the full Legislature would have passed the bill had it made it to a floor vote. Rubio was the first, not the last, in a line of state legislative leaders over years who would refuse to seriously consider the bill. Most cited privacy concerns.\nBut prescription monitoring databases in Florida and other states free to use Florida\u2019s model would have pinpointed rogue doctors, would-be pill mills and doctor-shoppers across the country, just as all three were beginning to converge. In doing so, it could have curbed a national opioid epidemic when it was just an emerging problem, not the monster it would become.\nOnly weeks after the 2002 bill was killed, Bush suppressed a sob as he discussed his daughter\u2019s arrest for forging a prescription. Court-ordered to drug treatment and then briefly to jail, Noelle Bush survived her pill addiction. The 2004 deadline for greenlighting a monitoring system passed. So did Purdue\u2019s million-dollar obligation to pay for it.\nBetween 2002, the year Rubio killed the database that could have identified doctor-shoppers, and late 2011, when the database finally came online, more than 20,800 Floridians died after taking prescription opioids, including OxyContin, annual Florida Medical Examiners\u2019 reports show. \u201cNot getting that bill through the Legislature resulted in Florida becoming the pill mill capital of the United States,\u201d said Burt.\n\u201cThere was heartache for thousands of families beyond measure and it didn\u2019t have to happen.\u201d\nFlorida Officials Were Told Of The Oxy Express",
                "Everyone knew prescription monitoring was going to kill the pill smuggling business, said a corrupt Florida Highway Patrol trooper as he drove a load of pills out of Florida, according to a federal lawsuit. Talking to the confidential informant in the seat next to him, the trooper speculated someone in Tallahassee must have a piece of the action, \u201cbecause (Scott) was so adamant about not putting that system in place. Right?\u201d\nIn Greenup, an infuriated Cooper told a reporter, \u201cIn my opinion, (Scott\u2019s) getting money from somewhere. He has to be.\u201d A few days later, recalled Cooper, \u201cA lieutenant with the state police I\u2019d been talking to down there called me, said, \u2018Man, just a head\u2019s up: I wouldn\u2019t come to Florida.\u2019\u201d In states on the receiving end of the Florida pill pipeline and among federal officials, Scott\u2019s resistance triggered outrage.\nIn Kentucky, where as much as 60 percent of the illicit oxycodone in that state flowed from Florida, Lt. Gov. Daniel Mongiardo proposed erecting billboards at the Florida line: \u201cWelcome to the Oxy Tourism Capital of the World.\u201d\nU.S. House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers, also from Kentucky, twice wrote Scott. \u201cCanceling Florida\u2019s prescription drug monitoring program is equal to firing firefighters while your house is ablaze,\u201d he wrote.\nGil Kerlikowske, director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, asked to meet with Scott. So did DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart.\nThree U.S. senators \u2014 New York\u2019s Chuck Schumer, West Virginia\u2019s Joe Manchin and Rhode Island\u2019s Sheldon Whitehouse \u2014 joined Florida\u2019s Bill Nelson in pointing out that the pills weren\u2019t just a Florida problem: There were \u201cserious ramifications for the rest of the country,\u201d wrote Nelson of Scott\u2019s reluctance to crack down. This is a perfect example of how political rhetoric, in-fighting and contrived agendas prevented an early stop to the emerging opioid crisis many years ago.",
                "But that was six years away. In 2001, towns in Maine reported an alarming uptick in crime tied to OxyContin. The first of several congressional hearings was ramping up. Critics and parents who lost children were piling on. Reporters were starting to write stories.\nIn November, Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth appeared poised to take on the company. Calling OxyContin street sales \u201ca major threat to public health,\u201d Butterworth told a state Board of Medicine committee that Purdue should consider temporarily taking the drug off the market. It wasn\u2019t only traffickers concerning Butterworth. It was the sales pitch.\nIn late 2001, Butterworth called a young assistant attorney general into his office and gave him a magazine article on OxyContin and an assignment: Look into Purdue marketing. Former Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth and Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg. The young lawyer, now-Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg, said he knew nothing about OxyContin. But he didn\u2019t like what he read.\nDuring the yearlong inquiry, 589 Floridians died after taking oxycodone. Nothing criminal was found, Aronberg later said. Instead, Butterworth and Purdue struck a settlement. As part of a $2 million deal, Purdue would pay to establish a prescription monitoring database, the same silver bullet sought by Bush. After Florida\u2019s computerized system was up and running, the same system would be free to any other state. The entire country, not just Florida, would benefit.\nIt could have been a groundbreaking deal. There was one catch. State lawmakers had to vote to create the prescription monitoring program by 2004, or Purdue would keep its money.\nMarco Rubio Kills The Anti-Oxy Rx Bill\nA political gight killed the program. \u201cAnd there was one person who was responsible,\u201d said former state Sen. Burt, now an Ormond Beach insurance executive. \u201cAnd it was Marco Rubio.\u201d\nA rising state lawmaker in 2002, now-U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio had the clout to make or break the legislation. He had been one of two state House majority whips and was on the fast track to becoming House speaker.",
                "\u201cThere were folks down there, where if I had an opportunity to, get my hands around their throat, I would have wrung their neck,\u201d said Huntington Mayor Steve Williams. On Florida\u2019s inaction he stated, \u201cThere was total evidence as to what was happening. It lays at the foot, in my opinion, of the public officials there that allowed it to continue on.\u201d\nGovernor Jeb Bush Backed A Solution\nOne of the first dinners Florida Gov. Jeb Bush hosted after moving into the governor\u2019s mansion in 1999 was a small one. Among those sitting at the table with Bush were Lt. Gov. Toni Jennings, state Sen. Locke Burt and James McDonough, who would become the state\u2019s hard-nosed drug czar. There was an urgent topic on the agenda that night: the explosion of prescription painkillers. For the state\u2019s first family, it may have been personal. Bush had talked publicly about one of his children\u2019s struggle with addiction.\nBy the time the meal ended, all had agreed on the need for establishing a prescription drug monitoring program that would collect information and track prescriptions written for controlled substances, such as oxycodone.\nAbsent a prescription drug monitoring database, there was no way to know whether someone was \u201cdoctor shopping,\u201d going from doctor to doctor, getting more and more prescriptions to feed their habit.\nAnd there was no way to know whether a doctor was overprescribing, key to pinpointing whether a pill mill was operating, and where. Similar databases had been adopted by more than a dozen states. It was being described as a \u201csilver bullet\u201d to curb overprescribing. Soon enough, $2 million to get the database up and running would be on the table \u2014 but it came with a catch.\nFlorida Attorney General Misfires Against Purdue\nIn 2001, OxyContin-maker Purdue Pharma was fending off early criticism of its blockbuster painkiller. At issue was whether Purdue\u2019s aggressive marketing campaign had misled doctors and patients alike. Purdue and three top executives later pleaded guilty to federal charges of illegally marketing the drug. Far from being safe and non-addictive, OxyContin carried the same addiction risk as morphine, and was every bit as potent.",
                "Joseph M. Hernandez was writing prescriptions from his car, a veritable pill mill on wheels, when he was busted in February 2010 on one count of trafficking in oxycodone.\n.Florida\u2019s Department of Health didn\u2019t file paperwork to restrict his license for almost 18 months.\nDuring that time, Hernandez wrote oxycodone prescriptions for Medicaid patients totaling 258,940 doses representing a taxpayer-footed bill of $130,165.\nPurdue Pharma\u2019s Profits Before Patients Creed\nKelly Skidmore is exactly the type of person Purdue Pharma\u2019s OxyContin marketing was intended to reach: Diagnosed with juvenile arthritis, the former state legislator\u2019s struggle with chronic pain began at age 4.\nSkidmore was wary of opioid painkillers, though, one reason her willingness in 2009 to work with Purdue was surprising. But she did it to get Florida\u2019s dormant drug monitoring database up and running.\nThen a state representative in a district straddling Palm Beach and Broward counties, Skidmore recalled that, \u201cThey came to me and said, \u2018Could you help get it across the finish line?\u2019 \u201d\nOxyContin and prescription opioids, a serious problem in 2002, had evolved into a full-blown crisis in the ensuing seven years. Broward alone had more pain clinics than it had McDonald\u2019s. Deaths tied to oxycodone had exploded, up by 263 percent since the prescription monitoring database had first been proposed and killed. Overdoses from prescription opioids were claiming more than seven lives a day.\n\u201cBy God, if we had had seven dolphins a day dying and washing up on Florida beaches, we would have been appropriating money and solving it,\u201d Skidmore said.\nSkidmore believed a database wasn\u2019t going to resolve the underlying addiction crisis. Still, it was a start. Not a silver bullet, but \u201cmaybe silver buckshot,\u201d she said. The database law passed with gaping loopholes. No health care professional would have to report opioid prescriptions or check the database before prescribing more, and the state refused to pay for it.\n\u201cJust to get that one little piece \u2026 took nine years of filing bills and then it had no teeth,\u201d Skidmore said. \u201cAnd it should have been the easiest piece.\u201d\nWhere Was The DEA and Everyone Else?",
                "\u201cMy buddy had a minivan and he would actually go down one week and take two to three people with him, and then the following week I\u2019d go,\u201d said Frazier. He still remembers the route: \u201cI\u2019d take 64 East to 77 South to 95 South. And it\u2019s just a straight shot.\u201d\nOthers followed suit. \u201cWhat got everyone started was because the doctors around here won\u2019t write a strong enough prescription,\u201d he recalled. OxyContin and generic oxycodone still could be had \u2014 just not in Kentucky, which had a prescription drug monitoring database.\nIn Florida, \u201cthere was none of that \u2026 stuff that they check and find out what doctor you\u2019ve been to,\u201d said Frazier.\n\u201cAnd one person does it, and then they tell a friend, and then they go do it, and that\u2019s how it all really got started here.\u201d\nMEDICAID-MEDICAIRE PAID MILLIONS FOR OXY\nTallahassee wasn\u2019t just ignoring the epidemic, It was financing it.\nBefore her office was raided by law enforcement in December 2001, Asuncion M. Luyao\u2019s patients would wait in a line in the rain to get prescriptions from the Port St. Lucie internist and acupuncturist. She was one of the most prolific prescribers of OxyContin in the state.\nAnd hundreds of thousands of those pills were being paid for by Medicaid, Florida\u2019s taxpayer-financed health program for the state\u2019s poorest and sickest citizens. Between 1999 and 2001, Medicaid shelled out $935,634 for OxyContin prescriptions written by Luyao. That was just OxyContin. Luyao was prescribing an array of addictive drugs. In the 12 months leading up to the clinic raid, Medicaid paid roughly $1 million for 7,000 prescriptions, only about 17 percent of them for OxyContin.\nNor did the raid slow her down. Between the raid and her arrest on trafficking charges four months later, Luyao wrote another 282 OxyContin prescriptions billed to Medicaid. She was not an outlier. In 24 months, taxpayers footed the bill for more than 49 million doses of pills containing oxycodone, even though there were only 1.36 million Medicaid patients. Half were children.",
                "The DEA all but wrung its hands over Florida\u2019s lethal inaction. The agency ticked off a devil\u2019s brew of regulatory loopholes: Florida\u2019s Health Department regulated health care professionals but not pain clinics. The state\u2019s Agency for Health Care Administration regulated pain clinics that accepted insurance, but pill mills were most often on a cash-only basis. And the prescription monitoring database, mired in a vendor dispute, remained stalled.\nIn early 2011, when Gov. Rick Scott took office, just one drug \u2014 oxycodone \u2014 was tied to six fatal overdoses a day. Deaths tied to all drugs claimed 25 a day. In the handful of Appalachian states where traffickers were bringing back South Florida pills, it was worse.\nOhio\u2019s death rate for oxycodone and similar opioids had doubled in 24 months, federal records show. Kentucky\u2019s was up by more than 50 percent. And in West Virginia, home to hard-hit Huntington, death rates tied to pill mill drugs such as oxycodone and Opana had climbed by 341 percent.\nThe DEA formally pinpointed Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade counties as the nation\u2019s single biggest hub for trafficking pills across state lines. Within weeks of being sworn in, Scott abolished Florida\u2019s Office of Drug Control, eliminating the state drug czar position, announced plans to drive a final stake in the heart of the database and rebuffed Purdue Pharma\u2019s renewed offer to help pay for it.\nScott, a tea party conservative, cited privacy concerns, expressed skepticism the monitoring program would work and raised the possibility taxpayers would be left with a $500,000-a-year bill to operate it.\nAttorney General Pam Bondi had also ridden the tea party wave to her position. She shared many of Scott\u2019s conservative convictions. Unlike Scott, the former prosecutor relentlessly lobbied to keep the database alive. Florida\u2019s failure to adopt the drug monitoring database was so out of step with the rest of the country that it began spawning conspiracy theories on both sides of the law.",
                "Bus and park benches touted pain clinics. When Smith picked up and thumbed through City Beat, a free magazine, he found pages of ads for pain clinics. \u201cIt would show young people sitting around a pool and it named the pain clinic and say (sic) \u2018we dispense on site,\u2019 and that really hit home hard.\u201d\nSmith stopped selling to pain clinics. But the company continued to shovel millions of oxycodone pills to Florida pharmacies. Masters executives figured the pharmacies would keep an eye out for excessive prescriptions written by pill mill doctors. But not all pharmacies were worrying about doctors at pain clinics, many pharmacies were courting the pill mills prescribers.\nA Lake Worth Family Pharmacy\nIn 2009, the small pharmacy off Lucerne Avenue in Lake Worth had a history. It had been in business for 43 years. The owner and head pharmacist had been there for 32.

There were signs in the pharmacy warning of limits on the number of oxycodone pills handed out. Even Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, an oxycodone manufacturer, was worried about the volume of its pill sales there.\nOf the 300,000 doses of all drugs the small pharmacy dispensed in December 2008, 192,000 were for oxycodone 30 mg, the dosage preferred by traffickers and users alike.\nThe huge oxycodone volume was no accident.

One man had used his 7-year-old son\u2019s Medicaid number to doctor-shop for OxyContin. A Miramar pharmacist who billed Medicaid $3.7 million for OxyContin pills was charged with paying Medicaid patients $150 each to use their IDs.\nMedicaid paid for more than $300,000 to fill Dr. James Graves\u2019 OxyContin prescriptions. The Florida Panhandle physician was the first doctor in the nation convicted of killing patients by overprescribing OxyContin.\nAddiction risk for people taking high doses of oxycodone begins climbing after just three days, a recent study concluded. And most people on Florida Medicaid getting oxycodone prescriptions in 2011 were getting much more than a few days worth. They were getting an average of nine months worth of pills, state officials said.\nPill mill doctors prescribed 1 million of those pills:\nDoctors working for the George twins\u2019 trafficking empire prescribed at least 102,081 oxycodone pills billed to Medicaid before the ring collapsed in 2010.\nWorking out of a Delray Beach pain clinic founded by a convicted drug smuggler, Zvi Harry Perper, son of the Broward County medical examiner, was arrested on trafficking charges, but not before he wrote prescriptions to Medicaid patients for 115,977 doses of oxycodone in 90 days.\nIn Lake Worth, Cesar Deleon was arrestedas part of a DEA pill mill sweep and charged with 55 counts of illegally distributing drugs.

From August 2008 to November 2009, a new pain clinic opened in Broward and Palm Beach counties on average of every three days.\nPharmacies and distributors are at fault as well, pharmacies ordered jaw-dropping numbers of pills from opioid drug distributors, the middlemen between manufacturers and pharmacies.\n90 of 100 of the nation\u2019s top 100 oxy-buying doctors in 2010, were in Florida. 49 of 50 of the country\u2019s top oxy-dispensing clinics were in Florida. For some reason this didn\u2019t raise an alarm or cause anyone to look further at the time.\nPurdue Pharma New What Was Happening In Florida\nPurdue and the Sacklers chose to ignore Florida, because apparently nobody there sued them or complained. In 2007, in other states, the infamous drug maker and three of its executives pled guilty in federal court and paid out $634.5 million in fines for purposefully misleading regulators, doctors, and patients about the addictiveness of their opioid painkiller. Around the same time, Purdue was also sued by several states, including Washington, over similar allegations. Purdue agreed to a $19.5 million multi-state settlement. And in 2015, Purdue settled a case with Kentucky, agreeing to pay $24 million.\nAs part of the state settlements, Purdue was supposed to set up monitoring programs to make sure that its opioid drug didn\u2019t wind up in the wrong hands. It was supposed to watch out for shady pharmacies, unusually large orders, or suspiciously frequent orders. But on this front, Everett alleges that Purdue once again put profits over people.",

Averill pleaded not guilty to manslaughter charges and awaits trial.",
                "The document reveals how the opioid epidemic was fueled by the pharmaceutical industry's promotion of over-prescribing practices, using a pain chart as a standard treatment tool. This led to widespread addiction, particularly in West Virginia, where drug companies targeted the state by supplying large quantities of opioids through loosely regulated pain clinics in Florida.

For example, Cardinal Health sold 3 million doses of oxycodone to two CVS pharmacies in Sanford, Florida, while Walgreens distributed 2.2 million tablets to a single pharmacy in Hudson. These actions contributed to the widespread availability of opioids, leading to addiction and overdose deaths. Legal efforts are ongoing to hold these companies accountable for their roles in the crisis.",

The addiction risk for high doses of oxycodone increases significantly after just three days, yet many Medicaid patients were receiving prescriptions for nine months' worth of pills.

This lack of oversight contributed to the distribution of hundreds of thousands of oxycodone pills from Ohio to Florida and back, fueling opioid addiction and related crimes in Ohio.

The company faced multiple lawsuits and fines for misleading the public about Oxycontin's risks, but these penalties did not deter their aggressive marketing tactics. The Sacklers' wealth, now estimated at $13 billion, is largely attributed to the profits from Oxycontin sales during this period.",
                        "The opioid crisis in the United States has been fueled by the actions of pharmaceutical companies like Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family, who profited immensely while ignoring the consequences of their actions. Distributors such as Cardinal Health and Walgreens are also implicated, having flooded communities with excessive amounts of oxycodone. For example, Cardinal Health sold 3 million doses of oxycodone to two CVS pharmacies in Sanford, Florida, while Walgreens distributed 2.2 million tablets to a single pharmacy in Hudson. These actions contributed to the widespread availability of opioids, leading to addiction and overdose deaths. Legal efforts are ongoing to hold these companies accountable for their roles in the crisis.",
                        "The document reveals how the opioid epidemic was fueled by the pharmaceutical industry's promotion of over-prescribing practices, using a pain chart as a standard treatment tool. This led to widespread addiction, particularly in West Virginia, where drug companies targeted the state by supplying large quantities of opioids through loosely regulated pain clinics in Florida. Residents from Huntington, West Virginia, would travel to Florida twice a month to obtain hundreds of pills per person, contributing to the state's opioid crisis.",
                        "In the early 2010s, Florida became the epicenter of a nationwide opioid crisis, supplying tens of thousands of oxycodone pills to states across the U.S. Despite DEA records showing Florida's role as the primary source of oxycodone for regions east of the Mississippi, state lawmakers and agencies failed to enforce regulations, allowing crooked doctors and clinics to flood the market with the highly addictive drug. This widespread distribution facilitated drug trafficking and addiction, leading to the eventual transition from oxycodone to heroin for many users. The illicit trade involved various groups, including high school students, crime bosses, and corrupt federal agents, who transported pills across state lines, often using creative methods to avoid detection.",
                        "Florida played a significant role in the nationwide distribution of oxycodone, with many individuals and organized crime groups involved in the illegal trade. Palm Bay man's Puerto Rican family bought pills for Holyoke, Mass., while a Lauderhill man was caught with oxycodone and morphine in Rhode Island. Joel Shumrak funneled over a million pills into eastern Kentucky, and \"VIP buyers\" organized van loads of pill-seekers to Jacksonville clinics. Vinny Colangelo created numerous internet sites to attract drug users to his South Florida clinics. The Mafia, including a Bonanno crime family associate, also participated in the trade. Florida-supplied oxycodone reached various parts of the country, including Salt Lake City, Seattle, Denver, Oregon, Nevada, Texas, and Alaska. In 2009 and 2010, Florida accounted for nearly 40% of the oxycodone 30-milligram tablets sold in the U.S., with 90 of the top 100 oxycodone-buying doctors located in the state. Pharmacies ordered large quantities of pills from drug distributors, highlighting Florida's central role in the oxycodone trade.",
                        "A Walgreens drug distribution center in Jupiter, Florida, sold large quantities of oxycodone tablets to various pharmacies, including 2.2 million tablets to a Hudson pharmacy and over 1.1 million pills to two Fort Pierce pharmacies. In contrast, a single Oviedo pharmacy purchased 169,700 doses in 30 days, leading to concerns about drug diversion and abuse. Oviedo's police chief warned Walgreens' CEO of rampant drug sales and misuse in the town's pharmacies. In Fort Pierce, a Walgreens pharmacist accidentally gave an extra 120 oxycodone pills to an addict, who later returned for more prescriptions. Cincinnati-based Masters Pharmaceuticals Inc., a major oxycodone distributor, sold mostly to Florida pharmacies, with oxycodone accounting for over 60% of its sales in 2009-2010. The CEO described the situation in Florida as \"the Wild West of oxycodone prescribing,\" highlighting the widespread issue of prescription drug abuse and distribution.",
                        "A man named Smith noticed ads for pain clinics in a magazine and decided to stop selling to them. However, his company continued to supply millions of oxycodone pills to Florida pharmacies. Some pharmacies were closely monitoring prescriptions, but others actively sought out pain clinics. One example is a small pharmacy in Lake Worth, which dispensed a large number of oxycodone pills, even though it was warned about the high volume. The pharmacy owner admitted to promoting this business with pain doctors. This situation was part of a larger issue where pharmacies in Florida benefited from the oxycodone supply from Ohio and the unregulated pain clinics in Florida."

                    [
                        "In Englewood, Florida, a pharmacy owner filled prescriptions for pain clinics, including some far away, leading to suspicious activities such as out-of-state cars in the parking lot and young men carrying large trash bags. The pharmacy, Superior Pharmacy, even shared space with a pain clinic. The DEA found that the pharmacy and its inspectors did not research the backgrounds of the doctors writing the prescriptions, which could have revealed criminal charges against some of them. This lack of oversight contributed to the distribution of hundreds of thousands of oxycodone pills from Ohio to Florida and back, fueling opioid addiction and related crimes in Ohio. Criminals like Christopher Thompson and David L. Kidd organized networks to buy oxycodone in Florida and resell it in Ohio, leading to arrests and calls for action to stop the flow of drugs.",
                        "Dr. Averill, a pain clinic doctor in Broward County, Florida, was linked to multiple fatal overdoses of her out-of-state patients who received large quantities of prescription pills. Despite efforts by other states to curb pill mills, Florida continued to ignore the issue, leading to a proliferation of pain clinics and contributing to the nation's opioid crisis. Averill pleaded not guilty to manslaughter charges and awaits trial.",
                        "Huntington Mayor Steve Williams expressed frustration with Florida's inaction on prescription painkiller abuse, blaming public officials for allowing the issue to persist. In 1999, Florida Governor Jeb Bush hosted a dinner to address the growing problem of prescription painkillers, leading to the establishment of a prescription drug monitoring program. However, the program faced challenges, including opposition from the Florida Attorney General, who initially criticized OxyContin-maker Purdue Pharma for misleading marketing. Purdue later pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the illegal marketing of the drug.",
                        "In 2001, Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth investigated Purdue Pharma's marketing of OxyContin, which he considered a major public health threat. After a year-long inquiry with 589 oxycodone-related deaths in Florida, Butterworth and Purdue reached a $2 million settlement to establish a prescription monitoring database. However, the program required state lawmakers' approval by 2004, which was blocked by then-state lawmaker Marco Rubio, hindering the nationwide implementation of the database.",
                        "In 2002, then-Florida House leader Marco Rubio blocked a vote on a prescription monitoring bill, which could have helped curb the emerging opioid epidemic. Rubio's decision was influenced by political retaliation against a senator who opposed a different bill. The lack of a monitoring system allowed rogue doctors and pill mills to flourish, contributing to the opioid crisis. Between 2002 and 2011, over 20,800 Floridians died from prescription opioids.",
                        "In Greenup County, Kentucky, Sheriff Keith Cooper faced escalating drug problems due to the county's proximity to interstate highways and airports that facilitated drug trafficking from Florida. Cooper tried to address the issue by reporting suspicious doctors to Florida authorities, but received no response. Meanwhile, Mikey Frazier, a local drug user, became dependent on oxycodone after a sports injury and began sending friends to Florida to obtain pills for him, highlighting the impact of the drug trade on the community.",
                        "A man named Frazier recalls how he and others from Kentucky would travel to Florida to obtain stronger prescription drugs, as doctors in Kentucky were not prescribing them due to a monitoring database. In Florida, there was no such system, leading to widespread abuse. One doctor, Asuncion M. Luyao, was a prolific prescriber of OxyContin, with Medicaid paying millions for her prescriptions. Despite a raid on her office, she continued to prescribe OxyContin, and her case was not unique. Over a two-year period, taxpayers funded over 49 million doses of oxycodone for Medicaid patients, many of whom were children.",
                        "The widespread abuse of OxyContin prescriptions through Medicaid in Florida led to numerous arrests and convictions of doctors and pharmacists involved in pill mills. These individuals, including Dr. James Graves, who was convicted of killing patients by overprescribing OxyContin, exploited the system by using Medicaid numbers and paying patients to use their IDs. The addiction risk for high doses of oxycodone increases significantly after just three days, yet many Medicaid patients were receiving prescriptions for nine months' worth of pills. Despite numerous arrests and convictions, Florida's regulatory response was often slow, with some doctors' licenses not being suspended until years after their illegal activities were uncovered.",
                        "Joseph M. Hernandez was caught in 2010 for trafficking oxycodone, but Florida's Department of Health took 18 months to restrict his license, during which he prescribed 258,940 doses of oxycodone to Medicaid patients, costing taxpayers $130,165. Kelly Skidmore, a former state legislator with chronic pain, worked with Purdue Pharma to get Florida's drug monitoring database operational in 2009. Despite the database's creation, it had significant loopholes and lacked enforcement, highlighting the slow response to the opioid crisis.",
                        "The DEA criticized Florida for its inadequate response to the opioid crisis, highlighting regulatory loopholes and a stalled prescription monitoring database. In early 2011, Florida faced a severe opioid crisis, with oxycodone alone causing six fatal overdoses daily. Governor Rick Scott, upon taking office, abolished the state's Office of Drug Control and opposed the prescription monitoring database, citing privacy concerns and potential costs. Attorney General Pam Bondi, however, advocated for the database's retention. Florida's resistance to adopting the drug monitoring system led to conspiracy theories and placed it out of step with national efforts to combat the opioid epidemic."

Critics, including U.S. House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers and three U.S. senators, argued that Scott's reluctance to enforce prescription drug monitoring had serious ramifications for the entire country, contributing to the early stages of the opioid crisis.",

                "By late 2003, however, National's performance in opinion polls remained poor. The party had briefly increased its popularity in the year following the election, but by October its support had fallen to levels only slightly better than what it achieved in the last ballot. English also appeared in a boxing match for a charity against entertainer Ted Clarke. This did not boost his polling or that of the National party either, with suggestions that it devalued his image as a serious politician. Don Brash, former governor of the Reserve Bank and a relative newcomer to politics, began to build up support to replace English. On 28 October, Brash gained sufficient backing in Caucus to defeat English in a leadership contest.\n\nShadow cabinet roles and deputy leader\nOn 2 November 2003, when Brash changed responsibilities for certain MPs, English became National's spokesman for education, ranked at fifth place in the party's parliamentary hierarchy. He remained in parliament after the 2005 election. In his new shadow education portfolio, English performed strongly, and remained a party favourite despite his election defeat as leader in 2002, eventually being returned to the finance portfolio in August 2004 as deputy spokesman (while still retaining responsibility for education).\n\nIn November 2006, Brash resigned as leader. English was considered as a potential replacement leader (running against John Key) or deputy leader (against incumbent Gerry Brownlee) in the ensuing leadership election. However, a contest was avoided when the MPs agreed a Key/English ticket would run unopposed in a display of party unity. English took over the deputy leadership and the finance portfolio in the Key shadow cabinet.\n\nFifth National Government (2008\u20132017)\n\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance (2008\u20132016)\n\nAt the 2008 election, English was re-elected by his electorate, winning by a margin of about 15,500 votes. He became Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand and Minister of Finance in the fifth National Government, being sworn into office on 19 November 2008 and continued to serve in those roles until becoming Prime Minister on 12 December 2014. He was also made Minister of Infrastructure in National's first term of government and Minister responsible for Housing New Zealand Corporation and minister responsible for the New Zealand flag consideration process in its third.\n\nHe was comfortably re-elected in Clutha-Southland in the 2011 election but opted to run as a party-list candidate in 2014.",
                "During the 2017 National campaign launch, English introduced a $379 million social investment package including digital learning academies for high school students, more resources for mathematics, and boosting support for teaching second languages in schools, and maintaining National Standards in the school curriculum. Prime Minister English also sought to defend National's financial management and economic track record and claimed that the opposition Labour Party would raise taxes. Early opinion polling had forecast a poor showing in the election for the Labour Party, but in early August 37-year-old Jacinda Ardern took over as Labour leader and seemingly energised younger voters.\n\nAt the 2017 general election, National won the largest share of the party vote (44.4%) and the largest number of seats (56) in the House Representatives. However, National lacked enough seats to govern alone due to two of the party's support partners, the M\u0101ori Party and United Future, losing their parliamentary seats. In response, English stated that the party would be entering into talks to form a coalition with New Zealand First. Following talks with the two largest parties, New Zealand First entered a coalition arrangement with the Labour Party. English was succeeded as prime minister by Jacinda Ardern on 26 October.\n\nOpposition (2017\u20132018)\n\nLeader of the Opposition\nEnglish was re-elected as National Party leader on 24 October 2017. At the time of his re-election, English announced his intention to stay on as leader until the next general election. On 13 February 2018, however, he stood down as National Party leader due to personal reasons, and instructed the party to put into motion the processes to elect a new leader. He also retired from Parliament. English's resignation followed weeks of speculation that he would step aside for a new leader. On 27 February, he was succeeded as party leader by Simon Bridges as the result of the leadership election held that day.\n\nPost-premiership \nIn 2018, English joined the board of Australian conglomerate, Wesfarmers. English serves in Chairmanships of Mount Cook Alpine Salmon, Impact Lab Ltd and Manawanui Support Ltd. He is also a director of The Instillery, Centre for Independent Studies and The Todd Corporation Limited, and is a member of the Impact Advisory Group of Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets.\n\nPolitical and social views",
                "English is regarded as more socially conservative than his predecessor, John Key. He has stated his opposition to voluntary euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, same-sex civil unions, and the decriminalisation of prostitution. As Prime Minister he opposed any \"liberalisation\" of abortion law.\n\nIn 2004, English voted against a bill to establish civil unions for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples. In 2005, he voted for the Marriage (Gender Clarification) Amendment Bill, which would have amended the Marriage Act to define marriage as only between a man and a woman. English voted against the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill, a bill that legalised same-sex marriage in New Zealand. However, in December 2016 he stated, \"I'd probably vote differently now on the gay marriage issue. I don't think that gay marriage is a threat to anyone else's marriage\".\n\nIn 2009, English voted against the Misuse of Drugs (Medicinal Cannabis) Amendment Bill, a bill aimed at amending the Misuse of Drugs Act so that cannabis could be used for medical purposes.\n\nPersonal life \nEnglish met his future wife, Mary Scanlon, at university.

                "First period in cabinet (1996\u20131999)\nIn early 1996, English was elevated to cabinet by Prime Minister Jim Bolger, becoming the Minister for Crown Health Enterprises and Associate Minister of Education (to Wyatt Creech). He was 34 at the time, becoming the cabinet's youngest member. After the 1996 general election, the National Party was forced into a coalition with New Zealand First to retain government. In the resulting cabinet reshuffle, English emerged as Minister of Health. However, as a condition of the coalition agreement, NZ First's Neil Kirton (a first-term MP) was made Associate Minister of Health, effectively becoming English's deputy. This arrangement was described in the press as a \"shotgun marriage\", and there were frequent differences of opinion between the two ministers. After their relationship became unworkable, Kirton was sacked from the role in August 1997, with the agreement of NZ First leader Winston Peters.\n\nAs Minister of Health, English was responsible for continuing the reforms to the public health system that National had begun after the 1990 general election. The reforms were unpopular, and health was perceived as one of the government's weaknesses, with the health portfolio consequently being viewed as a challenge. English believed that the unpopularity of the reforms was in part due to a failure in messaging, and encouraged his National colleagues to avoid bureaucratic and money-focused language (such as references to \"balance sheets\" and \"user charges\") and instead talk about the improvements to services the government's reforms would bring. He also rejected the idea that public hospitals could be run as commercial enterprises, a view which some of his colleagues had previously promoted.\n\nBy early 1997, as dissatisfaction with Bolger's leadership began to grow, English was being touted as a potential successor, along with Jenny Shipley and Doug Graham. His age (35) was viewed as the main impediment to a successful leadership run. National's leadership troubles were resolved in December 1997, when Bolger resigned and Shipley was elected to the leadership unopposed. English had been a supporter of Bolger as leader, but Shipley reappointed him Minister of Health in her new cabinet.",
                "English was promoted to Minister of Finance in a reshuffle in January 1999, a position which was at the time subordinate to the Treasurer, Bill Birch. After a few months, the pair switched positions as part of Birch's transition to retirement, with English assuming the senior portfolio. In early interviews, he emphasised his wish to be seen as a pragmatist rather than an ideologue, and said that the initiatives of some of his predecessors (Roger Douglas's \"Rogernomics\" and Ruth Richardson's \"Ruthanasia\") had focused on \"fruitless, theoretical debates\" when \"people just want to see problems solved\".\n\nOpposition (1999\u20132008)\n\nAfter the National Party lost the 1999 election to Helen Clark's Labour Party, English continued on in the shadow cabinet as National's spokesperson for finance. He was elected deputy leader of the party in February 2001, following the resignation of Wyatt Creech, with Gerry Brownlee being his unsuccessful opponent.\n\nLeader of the Opposition\nIn October 2001, after months of speculation, Jenny Shipley resigned as leader of the National Party after being told she no longer had the support of the party caucus. English was elected as her replacement unopposed (with Roger Sowry as his deputy), and consequently became Leader of the Opposition. However, he did not openly organise against Shipley, and according to The Southland Times \"there was almost an element of 'aw, shucks, I'll do it then' about Mr English's ascension\".\n\nAged 39 when he was elected, English became the second-youngest leader in the National Party's history, after Jim McLay (who was 38 when elected in 1984). He also became only the third Southlander to lead a major New Zealand political party, after Joseph Ward and Adam Hamilton. However, English failed to improve the party's performance. In the 2002 election, National suffered its worst electoral defeat ever, gaining barely more than twenty percent of the vote. English described it as \"the worst day of my political life\". Both party insiders and the general public were split as to how much to blame him for the loss, but most of the party believed that English would be able to rebuild National's support.",
                "Early life\nEnglish was born on 30 December 1961 at Lumsden Maternity Centre in Lumsden. He is the eleventh of twelve children of Mervyn English and Norah (n\u00e9e O'Brien) English. His parents purchased Rosedale, a mixed sheep and cropping farm in Dipton, Southland from Mervyn's uncle, Vincent English, a bachelor, in 1944. English was born in the maternity unit at Lumsden.\n\nEnglish attended St Thomas's School in Winton, then boarded at St. Patrick's College in Upper Hutt, where he became head boy. He played in the first XV of the school's rugby team. English went on to study commerce at the University of Otago, where he was a resident at Selwyn College, and then completed an honours degree in English literature at Victoria University of Wellington.\n\nAfter finishing his studies, English returned to Dipton and farmed for a few years. From 1987 to 1989, he worked in Wellington as a policy analyst for the New Zealand Treasury, at a time when the free market policies favoured by Labour's finance minister Roger Douglas (known collectively as \"Rogernomics\") were being implemented.\n\nEnglish joined the National Party in 1980, while at Victoria University. He served for a period as chairman of the Southland branch of the Young Nationals, and became a member of the Wallace electorate committee. After moving to Wellington, he served for periods on the Island Bay and Miramar electorate committees, respectively.\n\nFourth National Government (1990\u20131999)\n\nAt the 1990 general election, English stood as the National candidate in Wallace, replacing the retiring Derek Angus, and was elected with a large majority. He would hold this seat, renamed Clutha-Southland in 1996, until 2014. He and three other newly elected National MPs (Tony Ryall, Nick Smith, and Roger Sowry) were soon identified as rising stars in New Zealand politics, and at various points were dubbed the \"brat pack\", the \"gang of four\", and the \"young Turks\". In his first term in parliament, English chaired a select committee into social services. He was made a parliamentary under-secretary in 1993, serving under the Minister of Health.",
                "Sir Simon William English  (born 30 December 1961) is a New Zealand former National Party politician who served as the 39th prime minister of New Zealand from 2016 to 2017. He had previously served as the 17th deputy prime minister of New Zealand and minister of finance from 2008 to 2016 under John Key and the Fifth National Government.\n\nA farmer and public servant before entering politics, English was elected to the New Zealand Parliament in  as the National Party's candidate in the Wallace electorate. He was elevated to Cabinet in 1996 and in 1999 was made minister of finance, although he served for less than a year due to his party's loss at the 1999 general election. In October 2001, English replaced Jenny Shipley as the leader of the National Party (and consequently as Leader of the Opposition). He led the party to its worst defeat at the 2002 general election, and as a consequence, in October 2003 he was replaced as leader by Don Brash.\n\nIn November 2006, after Brash's resignation, English became deputy leader under John Key. After National's victory at the 2008 general election, he became deputy prime minister and was also made minister of finance for the second time. Under English's direction New Zealand's economy maintained steady growth during National's three terms of government. He became a list-only MP after stepping down as an electorate MP at the 2014 general election.\n\nJohn Key resigned as leader of the National Party and prime minister in December 2016. English won the resulting leadership election unopposed and was sworn in as prime minister on 12 December 2016. His tenure was only ten months, and included a three-month election campaign. In the 2017 general election, National won the largest number of seats but fell short of a majority. The parties holding the balance of power declined to support the existing government, and English was subsequently replaced as prime minister by Jacinda Ardern, leader of the Labour Party. English initially continued on as Leader of the Opposition, but resigned as leader of the National Party on 27 February 2018 and left parliament two weeks later.",
                "Allowances issue\nIn 2009, the media, including TVNZ and TV3 revealed that English was receiving about NZ$900 a week as part of a living allowance for ministers, to live in his own NZ$1.2\u00a0million Wellington home. At the time, English also received $276,200 in his annual salary as Deputy Prime Minister. It was also revealed other ministers with homes in the capital city were also claiming accommodation allowances. On 3 August 2009, Prime Minister John Key started a review of the housing allowances claimed by cabinet ministers. English subsequently paid back $12,000 and only claimed about $24,000 a year in living allowances. The Auditor-General's office said in September 2009 that they were making \"preliminary enquiries\" into parliamentary housing expenses in response to a letter of complaint from Progressive party leader Jim Anderton. Two days later English stated that he would no longer take up any housing allowance and had paid back all the allowance he had received since the November 2008 election.\n\nPrime Minister (2016\u20132017)\n\nJohn Key resigned on 12 December, and endorsed English as his successor in the resulting leadership election. Following the drop-out of both Judith Collins and Jonathan Coleman from the leadership election, English was sworn in as the 39th Prime Minister of New Zealand on 12 December 2016.\n\nEnglish appointed his first cabinet on 18 December. In a reshuffle, he appointed Steven Joyce to succeed him as Finance Minister, while most ministerial portfolios remained the same.\n\nIn February 2017, English did not attend Waitangi Day commemorations at the historic treaty grounds, reportedly in response to the Ng\u0101puhi iwi's decision to stop the Prime Minister from speaking at the marae. Ng\u0101puhi have protested the Government's negotiation of the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA), which the iwi believe infringes upon M\u0101ori sovereignty, and thus does not adhere to the Treaty of Waitangi. English had been invited to attend in an official capacity; his non-attendance was criticised by a Ng\u0101puhi elder and Opposition leader Andrew Little.",
                "In his first overseas trip as Prime Minister, English travelled to Europe to discuss trade ties, including a prospective New Zealand\u2013European Union free trade agreement. He first travelled to London on 13 January 2017 to meet British Prime Minister Theresa May. Discussing trade relations, English said the two nations were \"natural partners\" and would \"continue to forge ties\" after the UK's withdrawal from the EU. He also arranged to meet with London Mayor Sadiq Khan, Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.  In a meeting with Merkel, English received crucial backing from Germany for a trade deal with the EU. On 16 January, English stated that his government would continue to promote TPPA, despite the United States' decision to withdraw from the agreement. He explained that Southeast Asian countries would now be treated as a priority in negotiations\u2014he also asserted that the United States was ceding influence to China by its rejection of the trade pact.\n\nAt a press conference at the Beehive on 1 February 2017, English announced that the 2017 general election would be held on 23 September. The Prime Minister later confirmed that his party would approach ACT, United Future and the M\u0101ori Party if confidence and supply agreements were required to form a government following the election. In his second cabinet reshuffle on 24 April, English appointed Gerry Brownlee as his new Foreign Affairs Minister; he also promoted Nikki Kaye to the portfolio of Education Minister, and moved Mark Mitchell into the cabinet to become Defence Minister. The reshuffle was perceived as an election preparation.\n\nOn 13 February 2017, English welcomed Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to Wellington. The two leaders reaffirmed their shared trade agenda, and discussed changes to the Australian citizenship pathway which will affect permanent residents originating from New Zealand.\n\nOn 19 June, it was reported that Todd Barclay, who succeeded English as MP for Clutha-Southland, had clandestinely recorded one of his employee's conversations the previous year, and that John Key's leaders' budget was used to pay a confidential settlement after the employee resigned. English admitted that he had been aware of the illegal recording and the settlement, and thus implicated in the scandal.",
                "The pairing of John Key as leader of the National Party and English as his deputy has been compared to that of Bob Hawke and Paul Keating (in Australia) and Tony Blair and Gordon Brown (in the UK).\n\nEnglish acceded to the role of Finance Minister in the continuing wake of the financial crisis. In response to New Zealand's rising debt, English made budget deficit-reduction his main priority. His first budget outlined three focuses in New Zealand's financial recovery: \"improving the business environment and removing roadblocks to growth; investment in productive infrastructure; and improving the way government works\". One of his first acts was creating the National Infrastructure Unit, charged with formulating a plan for infrastructure projects and investments. He commissioned a government-wide spending review, with an aim to reducing government expenditure\u2014with the exceptions of a two-year stimulus package and long-term increases on infrastructure spending.\n\nIn April 2011, the Opposition criticised English for suggesting that New Zealand businesses could use New Zealand's low wages to help it compete with Australia. The National Government campaigned for re-election in 2011 on its economic record. The Government boasted growth for five consecutive quarters up to mid-2010, totalling 1.6% of real GDP.\n\nStrong growth resulted in a surplus of $473 million for the 2015/16 financial year, projected to rise to $8.5 billion by 2020/21. In his 2016 Economic and Fiscal Update address, English stated that reducing debt and tackling the costs of the 2016 Kaik\u014dura earthquake were higher priorities than reducing rates of tax."

In his 2016 Economic and Fiscal Update, English emphasized debt reduction and addressing the costs of the 2016 Kaik\u014dura earthquake over tax rate reductions.",

Other ministers were also claiming similar allowances. Prime Minister John Key initiated a review, and English later repaid $12,000 and reduced his allowance claims to $24,000 a year. The Auditor-General's office began preliminary inquiries into parliamentary housing expenses. In 2016, following John Key's resignation, English became the 39th Prime Minister of New Zealand. He appointed Steven Joyce as Finance Minister in his first cabinet reshuffle. In 2017, English chose not to attend Waitangi Day commemorations due to Ng\u0101puhi iwi's decision to prevent the Prime Minister from speaking, which was criticized by a Ng\u0101puhi elder and Opposition leader Andrew Little."

                "By late 2003, however, National's performance in opinion polls remained poor. The party had briefly increased its popularity in the year following the election, but by October its support had fallen to levels only slightly better than what it achieved in the last ballot. English also appeared in a boxing match for a charity against entertainer Ted Clarke. This did not boost his polling or that of the National party either, with suggestions that it devalued his image as a serious politician. Don Brash, former governor of the Reserve Bank and a relative newcomer to politics, began to build up support to replace English. On 28 October, Brash gained sufficient backing in Caucus to defeat English in a leadership contest.\n\nShadow cabinet roles and deputy leader\nOn 2 November 2003, when Brash changed responsibilities for certain MPs, English became National's spokesman for education, ranked at fifth place in the party's parliamentary hierarchy. He remained in parliament after the 2005 election. In his new shadow education portfolio, English performed strongly, and remained a party favourite despite his election defeat as leader in 2002, eventually being returned to the finance portfolio in August 2004 as deputy spokesman (while still retaining responsibility for education).\n\nIn November 2006, Brash resigned as leader. English was considered as a potential replacement leader (running against John Key) or deputy leader (against incumbent Gerry Brownlee) in the ensuing leadership election. However, a contest was avoided when the MPs agreed a Key/English ticket would run unopposed in a display of party unity. English took over the deputy leadership and the finance portfolio in the Key shadow cabinet.\n\nFifth National Government (2008\u20132017)\n\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance (2008\u20132016)\n\nAt the 2008 election, English was re-elected by his electorate, winning by a margin of about 15,500 votes. He became Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand and Minister of Finance in the fifth National Government, being sworn into office on 19 November 2008 and continued to serve in those roles until becoming Prime Minister on 12 December 2014. He was also made Minister of Infrastructure in National's first term of government and Minister responsible for Housing New Zealand Corporation and minister responsible for the New Zealand flag consideration process in its third.\n\nHe was comfortably re-elected in Clutha-Southland in the 2011 election but opted to run as a party-list candidate in 2014.",
                "English was promoted to Minister of Finance in a reshuffle in January 1999, a position which was at the time subordinate to the Treasurer, Bill Birch. After a few months, the pair switched positions as part of Birch's transition to retirement, with English assuming the senior portfolio. In early interviews, he emphasised his wish to be seen as a pragmatist rather than an ideologue, and said that the initiatives of some of his predecessors (Roger Douglas's \"Rogernomics\" and Ruth Richardson's \"Ruthanasia\") had focused on \"fruitless, theoretical debates\" when \"people just want to see problems solved\".\n\nOpposition (1999\u20132008)\n\nAfter the National Party lost the 1999 election to Helen Clark's Labour Party, English continued on in the shadow cabinet as National's spokesperson for finance. He was elected deputy leader of the party in February 2001, following the resignation of Wyatt Creech, with Gerry Brownlee being his unsuccessful opponent.\n\nLeader of the Opposition\nIn October 2001, after months of speculation, Jenny Shipley resigned as leader of the National Party after being told she no longer had the support of the party caucus. English was elected as her replacement unopposed (with Roger Sowry as his deputy), and consequently became Leader of the Opposition. However, he did not openly organise against Shipley, and according to The Southland Times \"there was almost an element of 'aw, shucks, I'll do it then' about Mr English's ascension\".\n\nAged 39 when he was elected, English became the second-youngest leader in the National Party's history, after Jim McLay (who was 38 when elected in 1984). He also became only the third Southlander to lead a major New Zealand political party, after Joseph Ward and Adam Hamilton. However, English failed to improve the party's performance. In the 2002 election, National suffered its worst electoral defeat ever, gaining barely more than twenty percent of the vote. English described it as \"the worst day of my political life\". Both party insiders and the general public were split as to how much to blame him for the loss, but most of the party believed that English would be able to rebuild National's support.",
                "First period in cabinet (1996\u20131999)\nIn early 1996, English was elevated to cabinet by Prime Minister Jim Bolger, becoming the Minister for Crown Health Enterprises and Associate Minister of Education (to Wyatt Creech). He was 34 at the time, becoming the cabinet's youngest member. After the 1996 general election, the National Party was forced into a coalition with New Zealand First to retain government. In the resulting cabinet reshuffle, English emerged as Minister of Health. However, as a condition of the coalition agreement, NZ First's Neil Kirton (a first-term MP) was made Associate Minister of Health, effectively becoming English's deputy. This arrangement was described in the press as a \"shotgun marriage\", and there were frequent differences of opinion between the two ministers. After their relationship became unworkable, Kirton was sacked from the role in August 1997, with the agreement of NZ First leader Winston Peters.\n\nAs Minister of Health, English was responsible for continuing the reforms to the public health system that National had begun after the 1990 general election. The reforms were unpopular, and health was perceived as one of the government's weaknesses, with the health portfolio consequently being viewed as a challenge. English believed that the unpopularity of the reforms was in part due to a failure in messaging, and encouraged his National colleagues to avoid bureaucratic and money-focused language (such as references to \"balance sheets\" and \"user charges\") and instead talk about the improvements to services the government's reforms would bring. He also rejected the idea that public hospitals could be run as commercial enterprises, a view which some of his colleagues had previously promoted.\n\nBy early 1997, as dissatisfaction with Bolger's leadership began to grow, English was being touted as a potential successor, along with Jenny Shipley and Doug Graham. His age (35) was viewed as the main impediment to a successful leadership run. National's leadership troubles were resolved in December 1997, when Bolger resigned and Shipley was elected to the leadership unopposed. English had been a supporter of Bolger as leader, but Shipley reappointed him Minister of Health in her new cabinet.",
                "During the 2017 National campaign launch, English introduced a $379 million social investment package including digital learning academies for high school students, more resources for mathematics, and boosting support for teaching second languages in schools, and maintaining National Standards in the school curriculum. Prime Minister English also sought to defend National's financial management and economic track record and claimed that the opposition Labour Party would raise taxes. Early opinion polling had forecast a poor showing in the election for the Labour Party, but in early August 37-year-old Jacinda Ardern took over as Labour leader and seemingly energised younger voters.\n\nAt the 2017 general election, National won the largest share of the party vote (44.4%) and the largest number of seats (56) in the House Representatives. However, National lacked enough seats to govern alone due to two of the party's support partners, the M\u0101ori Party and United Future, losing their parliamentary seats. In response, English stated that the party would be entering into talks to form a coalition with New Zealand First. Following talks with the two largest parties, New Zealand First entered a coalition arrangement with the Labour Party. English was succeeded as prime minister by Jacinda Ardern on 26 October.\n\nOpposition (2017\u20132018)\n\nLeader of the Opposition\nEnglish was re-elected as National Party leader on 24 October 2017. At the time of his re-election, English announced his intention to stay on as leader until the next general election. On 13 February 2018, however, he stood down as National Party leader due to personal reasons, and instructed the party to put into motion the processes to elect a new leader. He also retired from Parliament. English's resignation followed weeks of speculation that he would step aside for a new leader. On 27 February, he was succeeded as party leader by Simon Bridges as the result of the leadership election held that day.\n\nPost-premiership \nIn 2018, English joined the board of Australian conglomerate, Wesfarmers. English serves in Chairmanships of Mount Cook Alpine Salmon, Impact Lab Ltd and Manawanui Support Ltd. He is also a director of The Instillery, Centre for Independent Studies and The Todd Corporation Limited, and is a member of the Impact Advisory Group of Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets.\n\nPolitical and social views",
                "English is regarded as more socially conservative than his predecessor, John Key. He has stated his opposition to voluntary euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, same-sex civil unions, and the decriminalisation of prostitution. As Prime Minister he opposed any \"liberalisation\" of abortion law.\n\nIn 2004, English voted against a bill to establish civil unions for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples. In 2005, he voted for the Marriage (Gender Clarification) Amendment Bill, which would have amended the Marriage Act to define marriage as only between a man and a woman. English voted against the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill, a bill that legalised same-sex marriage in New Zealand. However, in December 2016 he stated, \"I'd probably vote differently now on the gay marriage issue. I don't think that gay marriage is a threat to anyone else's marriage\".\n\nIn 2009, English voted against the Misuse of Drugs (Medicinal Cannabis) Amendment Bill, a bill aimed at amending the Misuse of Drugs Act so that cannabis could be used for medical purposes.\n\nPersonal life \nEnglish met his future wife, Mary Scanlon, at university. She was studying medicine at the time, and became a general practitioner. Both her parents were immigrants, her father being Samoan and her mother Italian, born on the island of Stromboli. They have six children: a daughter and five sons.\n\nEnglish is a practising Roman Catholic, but has stated that he considers his religious beliefs personal and thus separate from politics.\n\nIn June 2002, English took part in TV3's Fight For Life, a celebrity boxing fundraiser to raise money for the Yellow Ribbon anti-youth-suicide campaign, influenced by the death of a teenage nephew in 1997. He lost a split decision to former university colleague Ted Clarke.\n\nHonours\nIn the 2018 Queen's Birthday Honours, English was appointed a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services of over 27 years to the State.",
                "Sir Simon William English  (born 30 December 1961) is a New Zealand former National Party politician who served as the 39th prime minister of New Zealand from 2016 to 2017. He had previously served as the 17th deputy prime minister of New Zealand and minister of finance from 2008 to 2016 under John Key and the Fifth National Government.\n\nA farmer and public servant before entering politics, English was elected to the New Zealand Parliament in  as the National Party's candidate in the Wallace electorate. He was elevated to Cabinet in 1996 and in 1999 was made minister of finance, although he served for less than a year due to his party's loss at the 1999 general election. In October 2001, English replaced Jenny Shipley as the leader of the National Party (and consequently as Leader of the Opposition). He led the party to its worst defeat at the 2002 general election, and as a consequence, in October 2003 he was replaced as leader by Don Brash.\n\nIn November 2006, after Brash's resignation, English became deputy leader under John Key. After National's victory at the 2008 general election, he became deputy prime minister and was also made minister of finance for the second time. Under English's direction New Zealand's economy maintained steady growth during National's three terms of government. He became a list-only MP after stepping down as an electorate MP at the 2014 general election.\n\nJohn Key resigned as leader of the National Party and prime minister in December 2016. English won the resulting leadership election unopposed and was sworn in as prime minister on 12 December 2016. His tenure was only ten months, and included a three-month election campaign. In the 2017 general election, National won the largest number of seats but fell short of a majority. The parties holding the balance of power declined to support the existing government, and English was subsequently replaced as prime minister by Jacinda Ardern, leader of the Labour Party. English initially continued on as Leader of the Opposition, but resigned as leader of the National Party on 27 February 2018 and left parliament two weeks later.",
                "Early life\nEnglish was born on 30 December 1961 at Lumsden Maternity Centre in Lumsden. He is the eleventh of twelve children of Mervyn English and Norah (n\u00e9e O'Brien) English. His parents purchased Rosedale, a mixed sheep and cropping farm in Dipton, Southland from Mervyn's uncle, Vincent English, a bachelor, in 1944. English was born in the maternity unit at Lumsden.\n\nEnglish attended St Thomas's School in Winton, then boarded at St. Patrick's College in Upper Hutt, where he became head boy. He played in the first XV of the school's rugby team. English went on to study commerce at the University of Otago, where he was a resident at Selwyn College, and then completed an honours degree in English literature at Victoria University of Wellington.\n\nAfter finishing his studies, English returned to Dipton and farmed for a few years. From 1987 to 1989, he worked in Wellington as a policy analyst for the New Zealand Treasury, at a time when the free market policies favoured by Labour's finance minister Roger Douglas (known collectively as \"Rogernomics\") were being implemented.\n\nEnglish joined the National Party in 1980, while at Victoria University. He served for a period as chairman of the Southland branch of the Young Nationals, and became a member of the Wallace electorate committee. After moving to Wellington, he served for periods on the Island Bay and Miramar electorate committees, respectively.\n\nFourth National Government (1990\u20131999)\n\nAt the 1990 general election, English stood as the National candidate in Wallace, replacing the retiring Derek Angus, and was elected with a large majority. He would hold this seat, renamed Clutha-Southland in 1996, until 2014. He and three other newly elected National MPs (Tony Ryall, Nick Smith, and Roger Sowry) were soon identified as rising stars in New Zealand politics, and at various points were dubbed the \"brat pack\", the \"gang of four\", and the \"young Turks\". In his first term in parliament, English chaired a select committee into social services. He was made a parliamentary under-secretary in 1993, serving under the Minister of Health.",
                "In his first overseas trip as Prime Minister, English travelled to Europe to discuss trade ties, including a prospective New Zealand\u2013European Union free trade agreement. He first travelled to London on 13 January 2017 to meet British Prime Minister Theresa May. Discussing trade relations, English said the two nations were \"natural partners\" and would \"continue to forge ties\" after the UK's withdrawal from the EU. He also arranged to meet with London Mayor Sadiq Khan, Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.  In a meeting with Merkel, English received crucial backing from Germany for a trade deal with the EU. On 16 January, English stated that his government would continue to promote TPPA, despite the United States' decision to withdraw from the agreement. He explained that Southeast Asian countries would now be treated as a priority in negotiations\u2014he also asserted that the United States was ceding influence to China by its rejection of the trade pact.\n\nAt a press conference at the Beehive on 1 February 2017, English announced that the 2017 general election would be held on 23 September. The Prime Minister later confirmed that his party would approach ACT, United Future and the M\u0101ori Party if confidence and supply agreements were required to form a government following the election. In his second cabinet reshuffle on 24 April, English appointed Gerry Brownlee as his new Foreign Affairs Minister; he also promoted Nikki Kaye to the portfolio of Education Minister, and moved Mark Mitchell into the cabinet to become Defence Minister. The reshuffle was perceived as an election preparation.\n\nOn 13 February 2017, English welcomed Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to Wellington. The two leaders reaffirmed their shared trade agenda, and discussed changes to the Australian citizenship pathway which will affect permanent residents originating from New Zealand.\n\nOn 19 June, it was reported that Todd Barclay, who succeeded English as MP for Clutha-Southland, had clandestinely recorded one of his employee's conversations the previous year, and that John Key's leaders' budget was used to pay a confidential settlement after the employee resigned. English admitted that he had been aware of the illegal recording and the settlement, and thus implicated in the scandal.",
                "The pairing of John Key as leader of the National Party and English as his deputy has been compared to that of Bob Hawke and Paul Keating (in Australia) and Tony Blair and Gordon Brown (in the UK).\n\nEnglish acceded to the role of Finance Minister in the continuing wake of the financial crisis. In response to New Zealand's rising debt, English made budget deficit-reduction his main priority. His first budget outlined three focuses in New Zealand's financial recovery: \"improving the business environment and removing roadblocks to growth; investment in productive infrastructure; and improving the way government works\". One of his first acts was creating the National Infrastructure Unit, charged with formulating a plan for infrastructure projects and investments. He commissioned a government-wide spending review, with an aim to reducing government expenditure\u2014with the exceptions of a two-year stimulus package and long-term increases on infrastructure spending.\n\nIn April 2011, the Opposition criticised English for suggesting that New Zealand businesses could use New Zealand's low wages to help it compete with Australia. The National Government campaigned for re-election in 2011 on its economic record. The Government boasted growth for five consecutive quarters up to mid-2010, totalling 1.6% of real GDP.\n\nStrong growth resulted in a surplus of $473 million for the 2015/16 financial year, projected to rise to $8.5 billion by 2020/21. In his 2016 Economic and Fiscal Update address, English stated that reducing debt and tackling the costs of the 2016 Kaik\u014dura earthquake were higher priorities than reducing rates of tax.",
                "Allowances issue\nIn 2009, the media, including TVNZ and TV3 revealed that English was receiving about NZ$900 a week as part of a living allowance for ministers, to live in his own NZ$1.2\u00a0million Wellington home. At the time, English also received $276,200 in his annual salary as Deputy Prime Minister. It was also revealed other ministers with homes in the capital city were also claiming accommodation allowances. On 3 August 2009, Prime Minister John Key started a review of the housing allowances claimed by cabinet ministers. English subsequently paid back $12,000 and only claimed about $24,000 a year in living allowances. The Auditor-General's office said in September 2009 that they were making \"preliminary enquiries\" into parliamentary housing expenses in response to a letter of complaint from Progressive party leader Jim Anderton. Two days later English stated that he would no longer take up any housing allowance and had paid back all the allowance he had received since the November 2008 election.\n\nPrime Minister (2016\u20132017)\n\nJohn Key resigned on 12 December, and endorsed English as his successor in the resulting leadership election. Following the drop-out of both Judith Collins and Jonathan Coleman from the leadership election, English was sworn in as the 39th Prime Minister of New Zealand on 12 December 2016.\n\nEnglish appointed his first cabinet on 18 December. In a reshuffle, he appointed Steven Joyce to succeed him as Finance Minister, while most ministerial portfolios remained the same.\n\nIn February 2017, English did not attend Waitangi Day commemorations at the historic treaty grounds, reportedly in response to the Ng\u0101puhi iwi's decision to stop the Prime Minister from speaking at the marae. Ng\u0101puhi have protested the Government's negotiation of the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA), which the iwi believe infringes upon M\u0101ori sovereignty, and thus does not adhere to the Treaty of Waitangi. English had been invited to attend in an official capacity; his non-attendance was criticised by a Ng\u0101puhi elder and Opposition leader Andrew Little."

                "Bill English, born on December 30, 1961, in Lumsden, New Zealand, is a former National Party politician who served as the 39th Prime Minister of New Zealand from 2016 to 2017. Coming from a large farming family in Dipton, Southland, English excelled academically and in sports, attending St Thomas's School and St. Patrick's College before studying commerce at the University of Otago and English literature at Victoria University of Wellington. He began his political career in 1980, joining the National Party and being elected as the National candidate for Wallace (later Clutha-Southland) in the 1990 general election.\n\nEnglish held various ministerial roles, including Minister of Health and Minister of Finance, and was part of a group of young National MPs known as the \"brat pack.\" He became the youngest member of the cabinet in 1996 under Prime Minister Jim Bolger, focusing on health system reforms. In 1999, he was promoted to Minister of Finance but held the position only until the National Party's loss in the 1999 election. English later served as the party's finance spokesperson and deputy leader before becoming Leader of the Opposition in 2001. Despite his efforts, the party suffered its worst electoral defeat in 2002, leading to a period of rebuilding.\n\nUnder John Key, English returned to the finance portfolio, serving as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance from 2008 to 2016. During this time, the National Party prioritized budget deficit reduction and infrastructure investment, leading to economic growth and a surplus by 2015/16. English's tenure as Prime Minister was brief, succeeding John Key in 2016 but facing challenges, including controversies over his living allowance and his absence from Waitangi Day commemorations in 2017.\n\nAs Prime Minister, English focused on strengthening international trade relations, securing support from Germany for a potential New Zealand\u2013European Union free trade agreement and promoting the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA) despite the U.S. withdrawal. He announced the 2017 general election, conducted a cabinet reshuffle, and introduced a $379 million social investment package aimed at enhancing education. Although the National Party won the largest share of the party vote, they failed to secure a majority, leading to coalition talks with New Zealand First, which ultimately formed a coalition with Labour, resulting in Jacinda Ardern becoming Prime Minister.\n\nEnglish, a socially conservative politician, has opposed voluntary euthanasia, physician-assisted suicide, same-sex civil unions, and the decriminalization of prostitution. He resisted liberalizing abortion laws and voted against civil unions, the Marriage (Gender Clarification) Amendment Bill, and the legalization of same-sex marriage. However, in 2016, he expressed a more accepting view on gay marriage. English also voted against the Misuse of Drugs (Medicinal Cannabis) Amendment Bill in 2009. A practising Roman Catholic, he keeps his religious beliefs separate from his political life. In 2018, he was appointed a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for his 27 years of service to the state. English resigned as National Party leader in 2018 and subsequently left Parliament."

                "Personal life \nBorn is married to Alexander E. Bennett (also retired from Arnold & Porter).  She has five adult children - two from a previous marriage to Jacob Landau and three stepchildren. Notably, Born was named a partner at Arnold & Porter while working part-time so she could raise her two young children.  When both of her children were school-age, Born returned to practice full-time.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nAttorney profile at Arnold & Porter\nBrooksley Born (2009 Winner) of the Profiles in Courage Award, with acceptance speech transcript and NECN video\n\nProfile at MarketsWiki\nSpeeches and statements\n\"Testimony Of Brooksley Born Chairperson of the CFTC Concerning The Over-The-Counter Derivatives Market\", before the House Committee On Banking And Financial Services, July 24, 1998.\n\"The Lessons of Long Term Capital Management L.P.\", Remarks of Brooksley Born, Chairperson of the CFTC, Chicago-Kent-IIT Commodities Law Institute, Chicago, Illinois, October 15, 1998.\n Interview: Brooksley Born for \"PBS Frontline: The Warning\", PBS, (streaming VIDEO 1 hour), October 20, 2009.\nArticles\nManuel Roig-Franzia. \"Credit Crisis Cassandra:Brooksley Born's Unheeded Warning Is a Rueful Echo 10 Years On\", The Washington Post, May 26, 2009\n Taibbi, Matt. \"The Great American Bubble Machine\", Rolling Stone'', July 9\u201323, 2009\n\n1940 births\nAmerican women lawyers\nArnold & Porter people\nClinton administration personnel\nColumbus School of Law faculty\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission personnel\nHeads of United States federal agencies\nLawyers from San Francisco\nLiving people\nStanford Law School alumni\n21st-century American women",
                "Legal career\nImmediately after law school Born was selected as a law clerk to judge Henry Edgerton of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. It was during this time that she met her first husband, Jacob C. Landau, who was a journalist covering the Federal courts at the time. Following her clerkship, she became an associate at the Washington, D.C.-based international law firm of Arnold & Porter. Born was attracted to Arnold & Porter because it was one of the few major law firms to have a woman partner at that time, Carolyn Agger, who was the head of the tax practice. Born took a two-year leave of absence from Arnold & Porter to accompany her first husband to Boston, where he had received a fellowship. During that time she worked as a research assistant to law professor Alan Dershowitz.\n\nBorn's early career at Arnold & Porter focused on international trade law, in which she represented a number of Swiss industries and the government of Switzerland. She developed a practice representing clients in numerous complex litigation and arbitration cases involving financial market transactions. Among her high-profile cases was the matter of the Hunt Brothers attempt to corner the market in silver in the 1970s. She made partner at Arnold & Porter, after moving to a three-day schedule to help raise her second child, and eventually rose to be the head of the firm's derivatives practice.\n\nBorn was among the first female attorneys to systematically address inequities regarding how the laws treated women. Born and another female lawyer, Marna Tucker, taught what is considered to have been the first \"Women and the Law\" course at Catholic University\u2019s Columbus School of Law. The class exclusively concerned prejudicial treatment of women under the laws of the United States, past and present.  Born and Tucker were surprised to discover that there was no textbook on the issue at the time.  Born is also one of the co-founders of the National Women's Law Center. Born also helped rewrite the American Bar Association rules to make it possible for more women and minorities to sit on federal bench.",
                "Born and the OTC derivatives market\nBorn was appointed to the CFTC on April 15, 1994, by President Bill Clinton. Due to litigation against Bankers Trust Company by Procter and Gamble and other corporate clients, Born and her team at the CFTC sought comments on the regulation of over-the-counter derivatives, a first step in the process of writing CFTC regulations to supplement the existing regulations of the Federal Reserve System,  the Options Clearing Corporation, and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Born was particularly concerned about swaps, financial instruments that are traded over the counter between banks, insurance companies or other funds or companies, and thus have no transparency except to the two counterparties and the counterparties' regulators, if any.  CFTC regulation was strenuously opposed by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, and by Treasury Secretaries Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers. On May 7, 1998, former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt joined Rubin and Greenspan in objecting to the issuance of the CFTC's concept release. Their response dismissed Born's analysis and focused on the hypothetical possibility that CFTC regulation of swaps and other OTC derivative instruments could create a \"legal uncertainty\" regarding such financial instruments,  hypothetically reducing the value of the instruments. They argued that the imposition of regulatory costs would \"stifle financial innovation\" and encourage financial capital to transfer its  transactions offshore. The disagreement between Born and the Executive Office's top economic policy advisors has been described not only as a classic Washington turf war, but also a war of ideologies,  insofar as it is possible to argue that Born's actions were consistent with Keynesian and neoclassical economics while Greenspan, Rubin, Levitt, and Summers consistently espoused neoliberal, and neoconservative policies.",
                "In 1998, a trillion-dollar hedge fund called Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) was near collapse.  Using mathematical models to calculate debt risk, LTCM used derivatives to leverage $5 billion into more than $1 trillion, doing business with fifteen of Wall Street's largest financial institutions.  The derivative transactions were not regulated, nor were investors able to evaluate LTCM's exposures.  Born stated, \"I thought that LTCM was exactly what I had been worried about\".  In the last weekend of September 1998, the President's working group was told that the entire American economy hung in the balance.  After intervention by the Federal Reserve, the crisis was averted.  In congressional hearings into the crisis, Greenspan acknowledged that language had been introduced into an agriculture bill that would prevent CFTC from regulating the derivatives which were at the center of the crisis that threatened the US economy.  U.S. Representative Maurice Hinchey (D-NY) asked \"How many more failures do you think we'd have to have before some regulation in this area might be appropriate?\"  In response, Greenspan brushed aside the substance of Born's warnings with the simple assertion that \"the degree of supervision of regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market is quite adequate to maintain a degree of stability in the system\". Born's warning was that there wasn't any regulation of them.  Born's chief of staff, Michael Greenberger summed up Greenspan's position this way: \"Greenspan didn't believe that fraud was something that needed to be enforced, and he assumed she probably did. And of course, she did.\"  Under heavy pressure from the financial lobby, legislation prohibiting regulation of derivatives by Born's agency was passed by the Congress.  Born resigned on June 1, 1999.\n\nThe derivatives market continued to grow yearly throughout both terms of George W. Bush's administration. On September 15, 2008, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers forced a broad recognition of a financial crisis in both the US and world capital markets.  As Lehman Brothers' failure temporarily reduced financial capital's confidence, a number of newspaper articles and television programs suggested that the failure's possible causes included the conflict between the CFTC and the other regulators.Faiola, Anthony, Nakashima, Ellen and Drew, Jill. The Crash: Risk and Regulation - What Went Wrong, The Washington Post, October 15, 2008.",
                "Born declined to publicly comment on the unfolding 2008 crisis until March 2009, when she said: \"The market grew so enormously, with so little oversight and regulation, that it made the financial crisis much deeper and more pervasive than it otherwise would have been.\" She also lamented the influence of Wall Street lobbyists on the process and the refusal of regulators to discuss even modest reforms.\n\nAn October 2009 Frontline documentary titled \"The Warning\"  described Born's thwarted efforts to regulate and bring transparency to the derivatives market, and the continuing opposition thereto. The program concluded with an excerpted interview with Born sounding another warning: \"I think we will have continuing danger from these markets and that we will have repeats of the financial crisis -- may differ in details but there will be significant financial downturns and disasters attributed to this regulatory gap, over and over, until we learn from experience.\"\n\nIn 2009 Born, along with Sheila Bair of the FDIC, was awarded the John F. Kennedy Profiles in Courage Award in recognition of the \"political courage she demonstrated in sounding early warnings about conditions that contributed\" to the 2007-08 financial crisis.  According to Caroline Kennedy, \"Brooksley Born recognized that the financial security of all Americans was being put at risk by the greed, negligence and opposition of  powerful and well connected interests.... The catastrophic financial events of recent months have  proved them [Born and Sheila Bair] right.\"  One member of the President's working group had a change of heart about Brooksley Born.  SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt stated \"I've come to know her as one of the most capable, dedicated, intelligent and committed public servants that I have ever come to know\", adding that \"I could have done much better. I could have made a difference\" in response to her warnings.\n\nIn 2010, a documentary film Inside Job further alleged that derivatives regulation was ineffective from the Clinton administration on. Along with fellow whistleblower, former IMF Chief Economist Raghuram Rajan, who was also scorned by the economic establishment, Brooksley Born was cited as one of the authorities arguing that financial derivatives increase economic risk.",
                "During her long legal career, and into her retirement, Born did much pro bono and other types of volunteer work. She was active in the American Bar Association, the largest professional organization of lawyers in the United States.  Initially Born was named a member of the governing council of the ABA's Individual Rights Section, eventually becoming chairperson.  Born and Tucker founded the ABA Women's Caucus, the first organization of female lawyers in the ABA.  She held several other senior positions in the ABA, including being named the first woman member of the ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary.  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, Born provided testimony and opinion on persons nominated for federal judgeships. In 1980 she was named chair of the committee.  As chair of the committee, Born was invited to address the U.S. Congress regarding the nomination of Judge Sandra Day O'Connor to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nIn 1993, Born's name was floated as a possible candidate for Attorney General of the United States, but Janet Reno was nominated.\n\nIn July 2009, Nancy Pelosi appointed Brooksley Born as a commissioner to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC).",

During her tenure on the CFTC, Born lobbied Congress and the President to give the CFTC oversight of off-exchange markets for derivatives, in addition to its role with respect to exchange-traded derivatives, but her warnings were ignored or dismissed, and her calls for reform resisted by other regulators.<ref name=\"nytimes\">Goodman, Peter S.

She then attended Stanford University, where she majored in English and was graduated with the class of 1961.  She initially wanted to become a doctor, but a guidance counsellor at Stanford advised her against medicine, so she majored in English literature instead.\n\nShe then attended Stanford Law School, one of only seven women in her class.  She was the first female student ever to be named president of the Stanford Law Review. She received the \"Outstanding Senior\" award and graduated as valedictorian of the class of 1964."
